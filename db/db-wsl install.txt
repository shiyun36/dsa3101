#To install db on localhost if db is not hosted online with data population
make sure to uninstall postgresql in windows before doing this.

open wsl and activate 3101_proj venv
run:  sudo apt-get install postgresql 
start pqsl by : sudo service postgresql start ##run this every time to start db

check if u get postgres=# after running: sudo -u postgres psql
then run: \password postgres and set password=123 or whatever

change .env file accordingly


if having problems with psycopg2, open wsl/git with venv and run the following
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

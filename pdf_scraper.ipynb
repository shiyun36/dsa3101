On our production sites, we make improvements focusing on working hours with\\nhigher priority considering the severity and likelihood of human rights issues. In the course of the due diligence\\nand assessment, we conducted surveys and interviews with workers.\\n\\nThrough these surveys, we identified the opinions of workers who prefer overtime work and those who don\\'t, and\\nreiterated to workers that overtime is voluntary, and is not mandatory. We also confirmed that there are high fire\\nsafety and chemical substance treatment risks in our suppliers, and reinforced on-site audits and measures to\\nprevent harm to workers of suppliers.\\n\\nIn 2024, we participated in the UNGC Business & Human Rights Accelerator to improve human rights due\\ndiligence and impact assessments which was on production sites and suppliers. Through this program\\ncollaborated with SHIFT, an international human rights organization, we defined priorities by applying UNGP’s\\nhuman rights assessment approach which consider the impact not only on employees and workers in the supply\\nchain but also on local communities and consumers. While this assessment didn’t identify serious human rights\\nviolations that require immediate action, it found a total of 26 human rights risks. In addition to the existing\\ninternal inspections and on-site audits, we reviewed reports from stakeholders such as employees and employees\\nof suppliers received through our general reporting scheme and other grievance handling systems. Fifteen high-\\npriority risks were assessed based on severity and likelihood. Four of these risks are related to consumers being\\nharmed in the course of using our products and services, which we manage as a top management priority, and\\nremaining 11 are risks in the area of working hours, forced labor (including forced payment of fees), discrimination\\nand sexual harassment/workplace harassment identified through the due diligence.

Following the on-site audit, we issue certificates to suppliers that receive a score\\nof 80 or higher out of 100 points, and 96% of them (48 companies) received certificates in 2023, From 2024, we\\nplan to expand the third-party on-site audit to all overseas business sites.\\n\\nOverview Environmental QESSE aD Governance ESG Data Appendix Oo & < >)\\n\\nClassification Major Items for Third-party On-site Audit Key Improvement Cases in 2023\\n\\nSigning an agreement banning forced labor for\\nsubcontractors, setting up plans to prohibit child\\nlabor\\n\\nLabor &\\nHuman Rights\\n\\nEmployment contract, rules of employment,\\nCompany\\'s internal regulation, a worker roster, etc.\\n\\nIdentifying processes in need of personal protection\\nequipment and posting signs to remind workers to\\nwear it\\n\\nSafety & Safety equipment license, equipment maintenance\\nHealth records, worker health examination records, etc.\\n\\nSeparately disposing of workplace waste and storing\\nit in a designated place\\n\\nHazardous substance management records, laws\\n\\nEnvironment . \"\\nand regulations/license management ledger\\n\\nCode of ethics, employee training, self-assessment Developing a documented policy and program for\\n\\nOther\\nintellectual property\\n\\nsystem, etc.\\n\\nSTEP 5: Monitoring Improvement Action Implementation\\n\\nLG Electronics requests improvements to address non-conformities identified in a third-party on-site audit.

In 2023, 1,032 non-conformities\\nwere found in the third-party on-site audits, of which 581 were addressed through improvements.\\n\\nMost of the non-conformities related to forced labor were identified as contracts with subcontractors that did\\nnot contain the requirement to properly prohibit forced labor, and subsequent on-site audits confirmed that\\nthese non-conformities had been addressed. An overseas supplier was identified as having asked foreign migrant\\nworkers to pay recruitment fees, so we requested the company to make a full refund to the workers. In addition,\\n72 foreign migrant workers were requested to pay visa and work permit issuance fees, as well as fees to the labor\\nagency. As a result, we conducted a separate audit on fees in partnership with RBA, and asked the companies to\\nmake a full refund that amounted to approximately USD 84.2 thousand.\\n cs Sustainability Report\\n\\noport for Suppliers\\n\\ng for Suppliers\\n\\nrelated training for suppliers every year to help them effectively respond to global\\n\\nate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) and the requirement to disclose\\nIn 2023, we launched training courses on ESG risk management and due diligence,\\n\\nion and management.\\n\\nonline training’ for all suppliers doing business with LG Electronics to strengthen\\n\\ncapabilities. 289 suppliers in Korea and 757 overseas suppliers completed the\\n\\nlabor, safety and health, environment and ethics and other contents related to LG\\n\\nent of supply chain and due diligence items, in seven languages (Korean, English,\\n\\nse, Spanish, and Thai).\\n\\nement practical training for our purchasers (7 employees from each department) in\\n\\njanize various ESG-related training and expand the scope of trainees to include our\\n\\nEnvironmental Social Governance\\n\\nESG Data Ay\\n\\nESG Management Support for Suppliers\\nLG Electronics provides support for various supply chain ESG programs to pror\\n\\nsuppliers.\\n\\nDirect Funding Technical Support (in partnership | ESG Management St\\n\\nwith the government)\\n\\nInterest-free direct funding\\nof about USD 28,7 million,\\nsupport for Win-Win suppliers by operating an\\nCooperation Fund of about organization dedicated to\\nUSD 1507 million and government-project\\ncontribution of about USD Expanding the support from\\n10.3 million to ESG Fund quality and productivity 2022\\n(as of 2023) to include ESG in 2023\\n\\nSupporting an expansion of\\nbenefits in the ESG area for\\n\\n- Supporting third-party\\n28 in Korea and 22 ove\\n- Reducing the proportic\\nthrough ESG self-asse:\\n- Expanding on-site audi\\ndepartments of other\\nsafety, environment ar\\nsupport their improver\\n\\nSupport for Carbon Emission\\nManagement Capability\\n\\n: Support for Training and In\\nBenchmarking\\n\\n- Establishing a system to enhance reliability of : Improving ESG capabi\\nthe suppliers’ carbon emission data through training on ethics policy\\n\\nies of suppliers F\\n\\n\\\\\\n\\n- Completing establishment of carbon emission : - Providing training for 289 Korean and F\\nt\\n\\nr\\n\\ndatabase within 3 years to provide consulting : 757 overseas companies (as of 2023)\\ntrainings for suppliers in Category C (middle _: - Providing cases of outstanding ESG\\nmarket enterprises and small and medium- management companies (SMEs)\\nsized companies)\\n\\nESG Management Support for Suppliers\\n\\nClassification Item Unit 2022\\n\\nInterest-free direct funding 25.2\\n135.6\\n\\nLG Electronics Win-Win Cooperation Fund\\n\\nFinancial support\\nsupport ESG Fund -\\nTotal 160.8\\n* Calculated based on the cumulative average exchange rate for the first half of 2024\\nClassification Item Unit 2022\\nESG ESG self-assessment 1,231\\nmanagement Third-party audit support 50\\nCarbon emission AGA\\n\\nstrengthening Carbon emission investigation Companies\\n\\nsupport management\\n\\nCarbon emission reduction\\nconsulting\\n\\nTraining support On/Offline training 528\\n\\n cs Sustainability Report\\n\\n1m Establishment and its Operation for Suppliers\\nin ESG training contents including RBA-based human rights and ethics in 2023\\nsuppliers.

Risk Management\\nLG Electronics’ climate-related risks are identified through top-down and bottom-up approaches under the\\nsupervision of the corporate-level Safety & Environment Council, and are integrally managed as part of the\\ncorporate-level risk management process.\\n\\nTop-Down Risk Identification and Assessment\\n\\nLG Electronics\\' ESG Committee, attended by the CEO and independent directors, is highest decision-making\\nbody for overall ESG issues, such as environment, energy, and climate change across all Divisions and sites.\\nThe committee makes decisions on the large-scale investments necessary to reduce LG Electronics’ climate\\nchange risk, approves new businesses related to climate change, and oversees the approval and performance\\nof LG Electronics’ mid- to long-term GHG reduction strategies and the expansion of renewable power use. The\\nstrategies and goals of each division and management organization reflect the company’s overall climate change\\npolicy and direction, which are endorsed by the committee.\\n\\nBottom-Up Risk Identification and Assessment\\n\\nAt the asset level, we define risks and opportunities to be managed on a daily basis, and at the operational level,\\nwe manage their implementation status on a monthly basis based on internal regulations around the environment,\\nsafety, and energy/GHG. This is based on the ISO 50001 Energy Management System and is managed under daily,\\nmonthly, and annual plans by applying the continuous improvement cycle of ISO 50001\\'s Plan, Do, Check, Act.\\nIn addition, risks and opportunities specific to LG Electronics’ products and solutions are managed by individual\\ndivisions and appropriate measures are taken.\\n\\nA Framework for the Integrated Management of Climate Change Risks\\n\\nEvery quarter, the ESG Council conducts a company-wide, integrated review of climate change risks and\\nopportunities and deliberate on measures to manage them. LG Electronics’ integrated approach to managing\\nclimate change risks involves discussing the issues, solutions, and new opportunities from the perspective of each\\norganization and Business Company in a single discussion process among all departments and leaders involved in\\nthe issue to effectively manage risks and secure new opportunities. The ESG Council is organized by the CSO and\\nattended by decision-makers from all departments related to the issues on the agenda. The council shares the\\nassessment of the risks or opportunities of each issue and establishes necessary measures. It also plays a role\\nin formulating financial investments, resource allocation, and detailed strategies to mitigate climate change risks\\nand seize new opportunities. Key issues discussed at the Council are reported to the CEO and ESG Committee for\\ndetermining future direction and final decisions.\\n\\nRisk Management Process\\n\\nLG Electronics identifies the impacts of major climate change-related risks through scenario analysis, and\\nestablishes and implements risk management plans based on these results.\\n\\n1. Definition of Major Risks\\n\\nLG Electronics classifies climate change risks into two main categories: business impacts and reputational impacts\\nrelated to social awareness. Business impact is the risk that climate change may have a financial impact equivalent\\nto a reduction in projects or production/sales. We managed this by establishing proactive response strategies for\\neach item, such as possible financial losses and loss of life. Reputational risk is defined as the risk of damage to\\nCorporate image and financial losses due to legal sanctions and conflicts related to climate change. In particular,\\nLG Electronics, which focuses on consumer products, categorizes reputational risk as a significant impact because\\na decline in corporate image due to legal sanctions or conflicts can lead to a decrease in sales, Physical risk is the\\nfinancial risk of direct damage to assets such as facilities and buildings. and reduced production/sales caused by\\nincreased frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, which increases the cost of doing\\nbusiness.\\n\\n2. Impact on LG Electronics by Scenario and Countermeasure\\n\\nLG Electronics conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis of climate change risks and opportunities using\\nthe NZE 2050 and NCD transition scenarios as well as the RCP” 1.9, RCP 2.6, and RCP 8.5 scenarios to derive\\nclimate change risks and opportunities and establish mid- to long-term responses. We are also establishing risk\\nand opportunity analysis and response plans for each scenario over the short term (0-3 years), medium term (3-\\n10 years), and long term (10-25 years) within a scope that includes LG Electronics’ production sites, supply chain\\n(upstream), and the product use stage (downstream).\\n\\n1) RCP: Representative Concentration Pathways\\n 142 2023-2024 LG Electronics Sustainability Report\\n\\n1) Transition Scenario\\n\\nNZE 2050 (Net Zero by 2050) scenario\\n\\nby 2050 to limit the increase in the global average temperature to 1.5°C by 2100, thereby averting global climate\\n\\nThis scenario proposes a path towards achieving carbon neutrality\\n\\nchange. The NZE 2050 scenario offers a narrow but achievable path towards this goal. To achieve this goal, the\\nscenario proposes the immediate, large-scale deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies\\nin the short term, as well as transformative changes needed to reduce carbon emissions. Specifically, it proposes\\na global reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by at least 45% from 2010 levels by 2030. In response, LG\\nElectronics has set a target of reducing GHG emissions by 54.6% by 2030 from 2017 levels to meet the 2030\\n\\nemission reduction plan based on the NZE 2050 scenario, and has completed verification from SBTi.\\n(Source: Net Zero by 2050 - A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector, 2021)\\n\\nNDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) scenario NDC (Nationally Determined Contributions) are national\\n\\ngreenhouse gas reduction targets set by participating countries in accordance with the Paris Agreement. Korea,\\nwhere LG Electronics’ headquarters and major production sites are located, has enacted the Framework Act on\\nCarbon Neutral Green Growth with the goal of achieving national carbon neutrality by 2050. As part of this effort,\\nKorea has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2018 levels (including\\nan 11.4% reduction in the industrial sector), and has voluntarily proposed efforts to reduce emissions, respond to\\nclimate change, provide financial resources, develop technology and capacity, and increase transparency. Moreover,\\nLG Electronics considers the regulatory aspects of the governments in each country where it operates to be\\na major scenario consideration. Recently, OECD countries, including Korea, have introduced emissions trading\\nsystems and carbon taxes, with other major non-OECD countries expected to do the same. It is also expected\\nthat investments in carbon reduction will increase in various fields, such as efficiency improvement, renewable\\nenergy, and nuclear power, and that energy sources replacing fossil fuels will expand. In addition, there is a risk\\nof rising raw material prices for LG Electronics’ products, which are produced through a global supply chain.\\nAccordingly, LG Electronics plans to continue investing in R&D and launching new products to ensure an efficient\\nproduction process and maintain competitiveness in decarbonization and energy efficiency.\\n\\n(Source: UNFCCC and government sites for national NDCs)\\n\\n< Overview Environmental Social Governance\\n\\n2) Physical Scenario\\n\\nRCP 1.9 scenario This scenario proposes achieving net-zero by 2050 to curb the global average temperature\\nrise to below 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels.\\n(Source: IPCC 1.5°C Special Report, 2018)\\n\\nRCP 2.6 scenario\\nto about 420 ppm of CO2 by 2100.

This could lead to catastrophic disasters caused by global warming. In particular, the RCP 8.5\\nscenario highlights the physical risks from global warming, including damage to coastal businesses due to sea level\\nrise, regional water resource depletion, and severe wind and water damage. This will require a close examination\\nof the potential damage to global manufacturing operations and supply chains, and a significant allocation of\\nresources to improve proactive response capabilities.\\n\\nTo ensure the sustainability of its global production bases and supply chain, LG Electronics is reviewing its\\nbusiness portfolio and considering changes to its business strategy to improve its adaptability to environmental\\nchanges. We are increasing investments that will improve our ability to respond to physical risks from severe\\nnatural disasters, and recognize the need for additional voluntary efforts beyond our carbon neutrality goal in\\n2030. We are also striving to strengthen external communications that can contribute to social change, such as\\npolicy changes and improving customer awareness.\\n cs Sustainability Report\\n\\nEnvironmental Social Governance\\n\\nEsGData @\\n\\nmplementing Carbon Neutrality\\n\\nElectronics has set a GHG reduction target of 54.6% by 2030 compared to 2017\\ncriteria, and has completed SBTi verification of its 2021 GHG reduction target by\\ntakes into account macroeconomic variables.

There are 2 scoring systems we will use. One is across industries and the other is industry-specific. (this is a test)

Getting scores:
- get metrics from extracted data
- based on the metrics, make a score out of 10
    > metrics can be either numerical data (eg % greenhouse gas emitted) OR indicator (eg diversity in board, presence of women in board)
    > numerical : scale it such that it ranges from 0 to 1
    > indicator: yes or no: 0 or 1
- find out the lower and upper bound of each metric
- consider whether using 1-(normalised score) is better

Across industries:
- across industries, ESG have equal weightage (33% each) — add the scores for each category 
- eg E have 4 categories, add them, until 33%
- final thing should be score out of 10

Industry-specific
- for that industry, look at what is more impt when they look at the ESG data
- eg ESG have different weightage depending on the industry (20%, 40% etc)
- look into how to determine the weightage (msci website) — alr have weightage for each industry 
- depends on whether we can extract all the data. limitation is in the way we extract the metric

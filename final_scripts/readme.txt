Refactored code into classes and modular functions ot make it more maintable, reusable adn trustable. 
extract_text_company_year.py corresponds to PdfExtractor.py 
RAG.py corresponds to RAGProcessor.py 

Refactored main.py to focus only on the high-level flow, leaving the core logic to be placed in separate modules. This promotes readability, maintainability, and ease of testing.

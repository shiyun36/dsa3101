# About the Project
## ESG Data Extraction & Analysis with NLP
As ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors become central to corporate strategy and investor decisions, companies face increasing pressure to publish transparent and standardized ESG reports. However, the lack of consistency in reporting structures makes manual data extraction inefficient and error-prone.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to automate ESG data extraction, normalization, and scoring. Our goal is to transform unstructured ESG reports into actionable insights, enabling businesses to benchmark performance, assess risks, and predict financial impact.

### Key Features:
1. Automated ESG Data Extraction ‚Äì Structured data processing from unstructured reports

2. Metric Normalization ‚Äì Standardizing ESG indicators for cross-industry comparison

3. ESG Scoring & Benchmarking ‚Äì Aligning with industry standards to enhance transparency

By streamlining ESG analysis, we empower stakeholders with a data-driven impact dashboard to visualize trends and drive sustainability-focused decisions.

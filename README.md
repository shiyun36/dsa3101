# DSA3101 Group 7 Project Instructions

## About the Project
Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors have become central to corporate strategy, investor decision-making and regulatory compliance. With the rising demand for transparency and accountability in sustainability, companies are increasingly required to publish detailed ESG reports. However, the manual extraction and analysis of ESG data remains labor-intensive and error-prone, particularly because these reports are often inconsistently structured. This results in a bottleneck for businesses trying to meet stakeholder demands. 
Our project thus aims to automate the extraction of ESG data using Natural Language Processing. By streamlining the extraction process, we aim to validate and interpret the data, transforming it into valuable insights. Our business goal is to provide an impact dashboard for stakeholders to visualize overall ESG trends and predict the financial impact of ESG performance on companies. This enables businesses to benchmark performance efficiently and deliver actionable insights.
The core challenge lies in the variation of ESG reporting formats. Companies use different frameworks, leading to non-standardized data that is difficult to compare across industries. This inefficiency hinders stakeholdersâ€™ ability to assess risks, identify trends, or make data-driven decisions. Moreover, the lack of standardization complicates cross-company comparisons.

By automating ESG analysis through NLP and AI, we aim to 
- Extract structured data, Normalize metrics.
- Generate scores aligned with industry benchmarks.

This approach not only enhances transparency but also helps companies align with global sustainability goals, mitigate risks, and unlock competitive advantages. Ultimately, our goal is to contribute to speeding up the building of a more sustainable and equitable global economy.

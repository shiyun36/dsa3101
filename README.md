# About the Project
## ESG Data Extraction & Analysis with NLP
As ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors become central to corporate strategy and investor decisions, companies face increasing pressure to publish transparent and standardized ESG reports. However, the lack of consistency in reporting structures makes manual data extraction inefficient and error-prone.

This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI to automate ESG data extraction, normalization, and scoring. Our goal is to transform unstructured ESG reports into actionable insights, enabling businesses to benchmark performance, assess risks, and predict financial impact.

## Features:
### 1. Automated ESG Data Extraction ‚Äì Structured data processing from unstructured reports

### 2. Metric Normalization using RAG ‚Äì Standardizing ESG indicators for cross-industry comparison
We use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) where the LLM is connected to our ESG database and retrieves the data for each ESG metric and normalizes it based on industry averages.
We do this using a JSON-based query system. For each ESG metric, we send 2 queries: value_query, which extracts the data for the metric and scoring_query, which normalizes the data to between 0 and 1.

### 3. ESG Scoring & Summary Dashboards - Benchmarking and visualisation of ESG data of companies
Our scoring system rates the ESG performance of each company out of 10, where a higher score indicates better performance.

### 4. Prediction Model for Financial Impact of ESG performance - Determine key ESG factors affecting financial performance
Our prediction model benchmarks companies using overall ESG scores, analyzing their relationship with financial metrics such as ROA, ROE, and stock growth. Separately, to identify the most influential ESG factors, we applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), selecting the top five ESG metrics that best predict financial performance.

Due to limited standardized ESG data, we initially fitted a simple linear regression model to estimate the financial impact of ESG scores across companies. However, as more data becomes available, the model can and should be refined to assess company-specific ESG-financial relationships. Future iterations may incorporate time-lagged financials, individual ESG metrics, and advanced models like ARIMA or VARMAX for deeper, more accurate insights.

## Local Development
If the need for local development arises with a locally hosted database, follow the instructions below. Ensure that the Docker Container has started.
1. Before Dockerizing the container, go to the db folders and its scripts and the main script. Uncomment the lines with
   ```
     db_name = os.getenv('db_name')
     db_user = os.getenv('db_user')
     db_port = os.getenv('db_port')
     db_host = os.getenv('db_host')
     db_password = os.getenv('db_password')
     conn = psycopg2.connect(f"dbname={db_name} user={db_user} password={db_password} host={db_host} port={db_port}")
   ```
  and Comment out line with `## SupaBase DB ##`.
  
  If missing in main file, add the above and comment out the DATABASE_URL and conn with DATABASE_URL.
  
  Then run step 5 from [Dockerizing the Project](#dockerizing-the-project)
  
2. Run the commands to create the local database in PostGreSQL.
```
docker-compose exec app bash
python ./db/db.py
```
3. Follow instructions from [Running Python Scripts](#running-python-scripts).
4.  To access the local DB with the pgAdmin4 interface. Ensure that pgAdmin4 container has started and put the below in your browser.
```
localhost:80
```
Sign in with
```
user@email.com
password
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** This can take awhile before localhost is accesible due to container size.
5. Click on Add New Server and input the following and save:
```
General Tab:
  Name: postgres (or anything you want)
Connection Tab:
  Host name/address: postgres
  port: 5432
  username: postgres
  Password: password
```
6. You can now access the postgres DB and the tables. Use SQL to query or right click tables to view data.

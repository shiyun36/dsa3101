It could be inferred that OCBC may have conducted internal assurance or engaged an undisclosed external company for the limited assurance.\n\nExtracted values:\n- `is_assured`: true\n- `company_name`: Not explicitly mentioned, but potentially OCBC or an undisclosed external assurance provider.\n\nSummary:\nLimited independent assurance reports are mentioned in the document, and the company involved in conducting the assurance is likely OCBC or an external provider not explicitly disclosed.'}, 'score': {'text': 'To determine the final score based on the given criteria:\n\n1. Check the value of ""is_assured"":\n   - If is_assured is true, assign a score of 1.0.\n   - If is_assured is false, assign a score of 0.\n\n2. Check if company_name has a value:\n   - If company_name has a value, assign a score of 1.0.\n   - If company_name does not have a value, assign a score of 0.\n\n3. Return the final_score as a float:\n   - Final Score = is_assured_score + company_name_score\n\nNow, let\'s apply this reasoning to the extracted values:\n- is_assured: true\n- company_name: Not explicitly mentioned, potentially OBC or an undisclosed external assurance provider\n\nBased on the above values:\n- is_assured score: 1.0\n- company_name score: 0 (as it is not explicitly mentioned)\n\nTherefore, the final score would be 1.0.\n\nFinal Answer: 1.0'}}"

       "'At the  same time, continued climate change has led to observable effects—from floods and heat  waves to droughts and dwindling ice caps—and may be linked to not-so-obvious effects, such  as potential increased health risks from air pollution, extreme weather events, and pressures  on mental health.In 2022, this included Hurricane Fiona, Hurricane Ian, the Afghanistan earthquake, and the  flooding in Pakistan.7 Pfizer 2022 ESG Report Recognized at the  Leadership  Level  for our CDP Climate Change  Disclosure  43.1%  Representation for  women at VP+ levels globally  28.1%  Representation for U.S.For example, with regards to our climate change goal, we aim to achieve the voluntary Net-Zero  Standard by 2040, ten years earlier than the expectations of the Standard.We also host investor-aimed  fireside chats to review priority ESG initiatives and topics, including on priority  areas such as equitable access and climate action.Impact Stories Performance > Appendix >  eS Pfizer  The health of our global environment impacts everyone.Climate Change 22 How our approach “xt} Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure  Reducing Emissions From Our Operations to environmental Rs We promote resilient and sustainable  .Proactive External Engagement supports the  Understanding How Climate Change Could Impact Our Business Sustainable ia Responsible Consumption and Production QO We aim to achieve environmentally  Development sound life cycle management and adopt  Sustainable Medicines 24 Goals (SDGs) sustainable practices  Pharmaceuticals In The Environment A= Climate Action  Waste G Through our goals we are taking urgent  Water Stress action to help combat climate change  and its impacts.Climate Change  We recognize global climate change as one of the defining  issues of our time requiring collective action to mitigate  the risks it poses such as increased adverse impacts on  human health and decreased access to critical medicines  and vaccines due to disruptions in value chains caused by  the greater frequency of severe weather.Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) climate pledge that calls on stakeholders in the U.S.Based on this, we recognize action is needed throughout  our value chain to help address the complex threat of  climate change.Proactive External Engagement  Tackling climate change requires action from all parties  across all sectors, and Pfizer urges governments both  in the U.S.and abroad to establish ambitious climate  policies to stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5  degrees.For additional information on Pfizer\\'s climate action  program, please see our:  * Climate Change Position Statement  * 2022 CDP Climate Change Response  1 CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard results for calendar year 2022 were not yet available at the time of publication.23 Pfizer 2022 ESG Report Environment Understanding How Climate Change Could  Impact Our Business  We are committed to transparency in evaluating the risks  and opportunities that climate change may present to  our business.To meet this commitment, we incorporate  the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures  (TCFD) framework into our enterprise risk management  governance process and voluntarily report aligned with  TCFD recommendations.CASE STUDY: ITAPEVI NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS PROJECT  As Pfizer sets out on its Net-Zero journey, we recognize the interconnectedness of climate  change, natural systems and biodiversity.Performance >  2019 2020 2021 2022 2030  (baseline) Goal  Climate change (Scopes 1 & 2)\".18 - 20  Climate Change;

 * Changes in this larger system may evolve for us  locally; and * Climate hazards could manifest due to natural variability  which is not fully captured by the models.Trends in some physical climate hazards are also more  difficult to project than others.Impact of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities on our  Businesses, Strategy, and Financial Planning  Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced  Pfizer\\'s business strategy and are incorporated into  financial planning.79 Pfizer 2022 ESG Report Appendix eS Pfizer  — Continued  Risk Management  Pfizer\\'s strategy for managing climate-related risks and  opportunities includes our ambitious 2040 Net-Zero target  covering our operations and entire value chain.We also track metrics relative  to our business continuity and disaster recovery programs  (e.g., number of supplier assessments completed; sites  Appendix with fully implemented plans for the management of risk  associated with natural perils such as flooding and severe  weather, noting it is not possible to state with certainty  whether individual weather events are a result of climate  change).These include  the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability Accounting Standards  Board (SASB), and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD).'"

    "This is a continuation from assignment1.Based on these newly sourced company ESG reports, and the the previous classification method from assignment1, I can classify these chunks of text into the E,S and G categories, so that model is able to better generate a response related to one of the particular categories. For example, the query could be \"What are the recent carbon emission goals of Pfizer?\" Since in the data loading portion of this assignmnet I have added Pfizer's ESG report that details ESG strategies, and \"carbon emission\" is under the \"environmental\" category, based on these contexts, the model is able to get the specific document chunk context and metadata (the categories) to answer this question."

However, I realised that there may be more than one sentence that could answer a query, and that some sentences may provide context for the next. Therefore, I am not sure what would be the optimal number of sentences to chunk together. If I have more time in future, I would classify each sentence, and link sentences that have the same category label sequentially together as one single chunk, for better context for the RAG application. \n",

However, since I have split the pdf into individual sentences during chunking, there may be multiple sentences that answer the query.

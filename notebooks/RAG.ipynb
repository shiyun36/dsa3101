    "Based on these newly sourced company ESG reports, and the the previous classification method from assignment1, I can classify these chunks of text into the E,S and G categories, so that model is able to better generate a response related to one of the particular categories. For example, the query could be \"What are the recent carbon emission goals of Pfizer?\" Since in the data loading portion of this assignmnet I have added Pfizer's ESG report that details ESG strategies, and \"carbon emission\" is under the \"environmental\" category, based on these contexts, the model is able to get the specific document chunk context and metadata (the categories) to answer this question."

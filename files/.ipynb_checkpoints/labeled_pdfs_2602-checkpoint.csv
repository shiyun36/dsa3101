Climate Adaptation  Climate Risk Management  Climate Scenario Analysis  Razer has modelled its climate scenario analysis using internationally recognised climate scenarios outlined by the International Energy  Agency (IEA) and the Inter-governmental Panel of Climate Change’s (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared  Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).,Environment - Energy
"These scenarios provide a set of climate-related, technological, geopolitical, regulatory, economic  and social characteristics and assumptions as described below.",Environment - Energy
"The IEA, IPCC’s RCP and SSP scenarios were coupled to approximate a best case scenario, a continuation of existing trends (business-  as-usual), and a worst case scenario.",Environment - Energy
"We have coupled these scenarios according to their relevant RCP, outlining the projected  emissions trajectory, and onto relevant SSPs to forecast likely social and economic impacts.",Environment - Energy
These scenarios were used to identify  relevant and material climate-related risks and opportunities to Razer.,Environment - Energy
"Assessing Climate-Related Impacts  Using these chosen climate scenarios and taking reference from the TCFD and IFRS S2 disclosure recommendations, identified climate  risks should be divided into two major categories: (1) risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy and (2) risks related to  the physical impacts of climate change.",Environment - Energy
"Similarly, Razer has classified climate risks into physical risks, denoting likely physical impacts  from the onset of global warming, and transition risks, denoting likely regulatory, market or social impacts that may arise as businesses  and societies transition to a low-carbon economy.",Environment - Energy
"Assessing Climate-Related Impacts #GOGREENWITHRAZER IMPACT | 3 5  REPORT 2023, RAZERINC.",Environment - Energy
Selected Scenario Scenario Description Temperature Outcome  Net Zero by 2050 Our best-case scenario draws from the IEA’s Net Zero Emissions by  2050 (NZE) scenario.,Environment - Energy
This signifies a Paris Agreement-aligned pathway  combining the socioeconomic conditions with a declining emissions  trajectory to hit net zero emissions by 2050.,Environment - Energy
"This scenario assumes ambitious, concerted global efforts to deal with  climate change, involving the implementation of comprehensive climate  policies, rapid innovative advancements into green technologies and  energy, the scaling up of green infrastructure and broad changes in market  and consumer preferences for green products.",Environment - Energy
"As aresult, the worst impacts of climate change are successfully averted,  reducing the impacts of physical climate risks.",Environment - Energy
"However, due to the  wide-ranging transformations brought about by global climate efforts,  significant transition risks are expected.",Environment - Water
"1°C to 1.8°C by 2100  Middle-of-the-Road Our business-as-usual scenario draws from IPCC’s SSP2 Middle-of-the  Road scenario, which assumes a continuation of existing and historical  trends.",Environment - Energy
Efforts to tackle climate change continue to be apace.,Environment - Energy
"In some  jurisdictions, these efforts evolve and consolidate, but on the whole, efforts  remain inconsistent and variegated.",Environment - Energy
"As an organization with operations and markets across the globe, this  scenario is of particular significance to Razer.",Environment - Energy
"Climate change continues  to be an important focus area but threatens to be overshadowed by issues  such as inflation and geopolitical conflict, leading to higher input costs and  greater impact on operational expenses and cost of goods sold.",Environment - Water
"We mapped this scenario pathway to RCP4.5, where global emissions  will continue to rise until 2050 but fall rapidly after.",Environment - Energy
"In this scenario, both  physical and climate risks are expected to materialize.",Environment - Energy
"2.1°C to 3.5°C by 2100  Regional Rivalry Our worst-case scenario draws from IPCC’s SSP3 Regional Rivalry  scenario, signifying worsening global conditions which impede progress on  climate change.",Environment - Water
"In this scenario, factors such as a resurgent nationalism,  concerns over security, competitiveness and growing regional tensions  push countries to focus on local and domestic issues at the expense of  international collaboration on climate change.",Environment - Water
"We combine this with an RCP7 pathway, where emissions continue to  rise, and double by 2100.",Environment - Energy
"While faltering efforts to tackle climate change  limit the scale of transition risks, the drastically worsening global climate  amplifies the severity of physical risks in this scenario.",Environment - Water

"This responsibility includes design, implementation and maintenance of internal control  relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Report and the measurement of the Identified Sustainability  Information, which is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.",Environment - Energy

"Our firm applies International Standards on Quality Management (‘ISQM’) 1 - Quality Management for Firms  that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements  and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and  procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and  regulatory requirements.",Environment - Energy
Practitioner’s Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance in the form of a conclusion on the Identified Sustainability  Information based on the procedures we have performed and evidence we have obtained.,Environment - Energy
We conducted our  limited assurance engagement in accordance with the ISAE 3000 (Revised).,Environment - Energy
This standard requires that we  plan and perform our engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Identified Sustainability  Information is free from material misstatement.,Environment - Energy
"A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company’s use  of the Criteria as the basis for the preparation of Identified Sustainability Information, identifying areas where  material misstatement is likely to arise in the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error,  designing and performing procedures to address identified risk areas as necessary in the circumstances, and  evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.",Environment - Energy
"A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in  relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the  procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.",Environment - Energy
"The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of  processes performed, inspection of documents, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and  reporting policies, analytical procedures and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.",Environment - Energy

"Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance  opinion about whether the Company’s Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.",Environment - Energy
"Inherent limitations  GHG quantification, particularly Scope 3 emissions, involves inherent uncertainty due to data variability,  estimation methods, and reliance on third-party information.",Environment - Energy
"Scope 3 often uses data from external sources,  which may not always be directly measurable, leading to a degree of uncertainty in reported figures.",Environment - Water

Reputational risk is defined as the risk of damage to  corporate image and financial losses due to legal sanctions and conflicts related to climate change.,Environment - Water
"In particular,  LG Electronics, which focuses on consumer products, categorizes reputational risk as a significant impact because  a decline in corporate image due to legal sanctions or conflicts can lead to a decrease in sales.",Environment - Water
Physical risk is the  financial risk of direct damage to assets such as facilities and buildings.,Environment - Water
"and reduced production/sales caused by  increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, which increases the cost of doing  business.",Environment - Water

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Datadog discloses non-GAAP operating margin and free  cash flow margin in this report.,Environment - Energy
"Datadog uses each of these  non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and  compare operating results across accounting periods, for  internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-  and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate Datadog’s  financial performance.",Environment - Energy
"Datadog believes they are useful to  investors as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating  its operational performance, as further discussed below.",Environment - Energy
"Datadog’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide  information that is directly comparable to that provided  by other companies in its industry, as other companies  in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results  differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual  items.",Environment - Energy
"In addition, there are limitations in using non-  GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial  measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and  may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used  by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a  material impact on Datadog’s reported financial results.",Environment - Energy
"Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in  isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information  prepared in accordance with GAAP.",Environment - Energy
A reconciliation of  the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most  directly comparable GAAP measures has been  provided in the financial statement tables included  below in this report.,Environment - Energy
"Datadog defines non-GAAP operating margin as the  respective GAAP operating margin, adjusted for, as  applicable: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) the  amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) employer payroll  taxes on employee stock transactions; (4) amortization of  issuance costs; and (5) an assumed provision for income  taxes based on our long-term projected tax rate.",Environment - Energy
"Our  estimated long-term projected tax rate is subject to change  for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global  tax environment, significant changes in Datadog's geographic  earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business  operations.",Environment - Energy
We will re-evaluate our long-term projected  tax rate as appropriate.,Environment - Energy
"Datadog defines free cash flow as  net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital  expenditures and minus capitalized software development  costs.",Environment - Energy
You are encouraged to review the reconciliation of  these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most  directly comparable GAAP financial measures.,Environment - Energy
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures  are useful to investors and others in assessing Datadog’s  operating performance due to the following factors:  Stock-based compensation.,Environment - Energy
Datadog utilizes stock-based  compensation to attract and retain employees.,Environment - Energy
"It is  principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of  its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to  address operational performance for any particular period.",Environment - Energy
"As a result, stock-based compensation expenses vary  for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and  operational performance in any particular period.",Environment - Energy
Amortization of acquired intangibles.,Environment - Energy
Datadog views  amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising  from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an Contents 32  acquisition.,Environment - Energy
"While these intangible assets are evaluated for  impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired  intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by  Operations during any particular period.",Environment - Energy
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions.,Environment - Energy
Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity  incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise  or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of  Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise.,Environment - Energy
"As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period  independent of the financial and operating performance of  Datadog’s business.",Environment - Energy
Amortization of issuance costs.,Environment - Energy
"In June 2020, Datadog  issued $747.5 million of convertible senior notes due 2025,  which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%.",Environment - Energy
"Debt  issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the  convertible debt instrument, are amortized as interest  expense over the term.",Environment - Energy
"The expense for the amortization  of debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe  the exclusion of this interest expense will provide fora  more useful comparison of our operational performance in  different periods.",Environment - Energy
"Additionally, Datadog’s management believes that the non-  GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to  investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides  useful information in understanding and evaluating the  strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash  that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in  our business.",Environment - Waste & Pollutants

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures  Datadog discloses non-GAAP operating margin and free  cash flow margin in this report.,['No Label']
"Datadog uses each of these  non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand and  compare operating results across accounting periods, for  internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, for short-  and long-term operating plans, and to evaluate Datadog’s  financial performance.",['No Label']
"Datadog believes they are useful to  investors as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating  its operational performance, as further discussed below.",['No Label']
"Datadog’s non-GAAP financial measures may not provide  information that is directly comparable to that provided  by other companies in its industry, as other companies  in its industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results  differently, particularly related to non-recurring and unusual  items.",['Social - Customer Relations']
"In addition, there are limitations in using non-  GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial  measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and  may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used  by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a  material impact on Datadog’s reported financial results.",['Social - Customer Relations']
"Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in  isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information  prepared in accordance with GAAP.",['Social - Customer Relations']
A reconciliation of  the historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most  directly comparable GAAP measures has been  provided in the financial statement tables included  below in this report.,['Social - Customer Relations']
"Datadog defines non-GAAP operating margin as the  respective GAAP operating margin, adjusted for, as  applicable: (1) stock-based compensation expense; (2) the  amortization of acquired intangibles; (3) employer payroll  taxes on employee stock transactions; (4) amortization of  issuance costs; and (5) an assumed provision for income  taxes based on our long-term projected tax rate.",['Social - Customer Relations']
"Our  estimated long-term projected tax rate is subject to change  for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global  tax environment, significant changes in Datadog's geographic  earnings mix, or other changes to our strategy or business  operations.",['Social - Customer Relations']
We will re-evaluate our long-term projected  tax rate as appropriate.,['Social - Customer Relations']
"Datadog defines free cash flow as  net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital  expenditures and minus capitalized software development  costs.",['Social - Customer Relations']
You are encouraged to review the reconciliation of  these historical non-GAAP financial measures to their most  directly comparable GAAP financial measures.,['Social - Customer Relations']
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures  are useful to investors and others in assessing Datadog’s  operating performance due to the following factors:  Stock-based compensation.,['No Label']
Datadog utilizes stock-based  compensation to attract and retain employees.,['Social - Community investment']
"It is  principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of  its stockholders and at long-term retention, rather than to  address operational performance for any particular period.",['No Label']
"As a result, stock-based compensation expenses vary  for reasons that are generally unrelated to financial and  operational performance in any particular period.",['No Label']
Amortization of acquired intangibles.,['No Label']
Datadog views  amortization of acquired intangible assets as items arising  from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an Contents 32  acquisition.,['No Label']
"While these intangible assets are evaluated for  impairment regularly, amortization of the cost of acquired  intangibles is an expense that is not typically affected by  Operations during any particular period.",['No Label']
Employer payroll taxes on employee stock transactions.,['Social - Community investment']
Datadog excludes employer payroll tax expense on equity  incentive plans as these expenses are tied to the exercise  or vesting of underlying equity awards and the price of  Datadog’s common stock at the time of vesting or exercise.,['Social - Customer Relations']
"As a result, these taxes may vary in any particular period  independent of the financial and operating performance of  Datadog’s business.",['No Label']
Amortization of issuance costs.,['Social - Customer Relations']
"In June 2020, Datadog  issued $747.5 million of convertible senior notes due 2025,  which bear interest at an annual fixed rate of 0.125%.",['No Label']
"Debt  issuance costs, which reduce the carrying value of the  convertible debt instrument, are amortized as interest  expense over the term.",['Social - Customer Relations']
"The expense for the amortization  of debt issuance costs is a non-cash item, and we believe  the exclusion of this interest expense will provide fora  more useful comparison of our operational performance in  different periods.",['Social - Customer Relations']
"Additionally, Datadog’s management believes that the non-  GAAP financial measure free cash flow is meaningful to  investors because it is a measure of liquidity that provides  useful information in understanding and evaluating the  strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash  that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in  our business.",['Governance - Risk & Crisis Management']
"Free cash flow represents net cash provided  by operating activities, reduced by capital expenditures  and capitalized software development costs, if any.",['Social - Customer Relations']
The  reduction of capital expenditures and amounts capitalized  for software development facilitates comparisons of  Datadog's liquidity on a period-to-period basis and excludes  items that management does not consider to be indicative  of our liquidity.,['Governance - Risk & Crisis Management']

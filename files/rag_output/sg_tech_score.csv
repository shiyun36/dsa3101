The document mentions that Scope 2 emissions from all indirect emissions are attributed to electricity and heating usage in all regional offices. However, there is no specific mention of the total Scope 1 emissions for Singapore in 2023.\n\n2. It states that there are no Scope 1 emissions incurred and that Scope 2 emissions make up 0.2% of the total emissions. While it provides some information on Scope 2 emissions, there is no explicit mention of the total emissions.\n\n3. The document discusses Scope 3 emissions from various sources like purchased goods and services, fuel and energy-related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, and downstream transportation and distribution. It doesn\'t directly state the total Scope 3 emissions for Singapore in 2023.\n\nSince the total carbon emissions for Singapore in 2023 are not explicitly provided in the text, we can look for greenhouse gas emissions reduction information. The document indicates the calculation of Avoided Emissions, which could represent a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

    "- **ESG Risk Prediction:** Provide a **risk score between 0 and 1**, representing the ESG risk level. This should be based on the context of the report, including trends and potential threats to ESG goals.\n",

    "  - When possible, **connect ESG actions to business impact** (e.g., \"These efforts align with the company's sustainability goals and regulatory compliance requirements.\").\n",
    "- **Relevance Score:** Assign a score (**High, Medium, or Low**) based on the **importance and specificity** of the information in the ESG context.\n",

    "# - **Relevance Score:** Assign a score (**High, Medium, or Low**) based on the **importance and specificity** of the information in the ESG context.\n",

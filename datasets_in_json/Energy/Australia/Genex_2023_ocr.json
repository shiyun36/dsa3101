    "After a program of reverse cycle diamond drill exploration boreholes were completed underground, it was determined by Genex and its EPC contractor that the best course of action was to re-design the path of the MAT away from the zone into safer geology.",

    "2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies a) Investment in joint ventures A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture.",
    "Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.",
    "The considerations made in determining joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.",
    "The Consolidated Entity’s investments in its joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.",
    "Under the equity method, the investment in a joint venture is initially recognised at cost.",
    "The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Consolidated Entity’s share of net assets of the joint venture since the acquisition date.",
    "Goodwill relating to the joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not tested for impairment separately.",
    "The statement of profit or loss reflects the Consolidated Entity’s share of the results of operations of the joint venture.",
    "Any change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Consolidated Entity’s OCI.",

    "The Consolidated Entity uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data is available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.",
    "All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: e Level 1— Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e Level 2 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable; or e Level 3 — Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.",

    "Financial assets i) Initial recognition and measurement At initial recognition, financial assets are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through OCI, and fair value through profit or loss.",

    "The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.",
    "ECLs are recognised in two stages.",
    "For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12 months (a 12- month ECL).",
    "For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, aloss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of the timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).",
    "For trade and other receivables, the Consolidated Entity applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.",
    "Therefore, the Consolidated Entity does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.",
    "The Consolidated Entity has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment.",

    "A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.",
    "Financial liabilities i) Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.",
    "All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.",
    "The Consolidated Entity’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.",
    "ii) Subsequent measurement For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities are classified in two categories: e Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss; and e Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings).",
    "Financial liabilities at amortised cost (loans and borrowings) This is the category most relevant to the Consolidated Entity.",
    "After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.",
    "Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.",
    "Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.",
    "The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.",
    "This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.",

    "When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified; such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.",
    "The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.",
    "Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the consolidated statement of financial position if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.",
    "0) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Initial recognition and subsequent measurement The Consolidated Entity uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, to hedge its interest rate exposures in certain circumstances.",
    "Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.",
    "Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.",
    "For purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: e Cashflow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised firm commitment.",
    "At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Consolidated Entity formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which it wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.",
    "The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Consolidated Entity will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined).",
    "A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: GENEX FY2023 - ANNUAL REPORT 74 CHAIRMAN’S LETTER CEO'S REVIEW OF OPERATIONS DIRECTORS’ REPORT AUDITOR'S INDEPENDENCE DECLARATION z =] = a fe co lq 2 wi 4 = rr | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DIRECTORS’ DECLARATION INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT ASX ADDITIONAL INFORMATION e The effect of credit risk does not ‘dominate the value changes’ that result from that economic relationship; and e The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Consolidated Entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Consolidated Entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.",
    "Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.",
    "The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item.",
    "The Consolidated Entity designates only the spot element of forward contracts as a hedging instrument.",
    "The forward element is recognised in OCI and accumulated in a separate component of equity under cost of hedging reserve.",
    "The Consolidated Entity uses interest rate swaps as hedges of its exposure to interest rate risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments in certain circumstances.",
    "The ineffective portion relating to interest rate swaps is recognised as other expense.",
    "Refer to Note 25 for more details.",
    "The amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss.",
    "If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur.",
    "Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.",
    "After discontinuation, once the hedged cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction.",

    "An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or a cash- generating unit's (CGU) fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.",
    "The recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.",
    "When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.",
    "In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.",
    "In determining fair value less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account.",
    "If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.",
    "These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded companies or other available fair value indicators.",
    "The Consolidated Entity bases its impairment calculation on most recent budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Consolidated Entity’s CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.",
    "These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a minimum period of five years, however given the long term and predictable nature of the Consolidated Entity’s operations, these are generally extended to cover the useful life of each CGU.",
    "Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised inthe statement of profit orloss in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for properties previously revalued with the revaluation taken to OCI.",
    "For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognised impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased.",
    "If such indication exists, the Consolidated Entity estimates the assets’ or CGUs' recoverable amount.",
    "A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.",
    "The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.",
    "Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss unless the asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case, the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.",
    "The Consolidated Entity assesses where climate risks could have a significant impact, such as the introduction of emission-reduction legislation that may increase manufacturing costs.",
    "These risks in relation to climate- related matters are included as key assumptions where they materially impact the measure of recoverable amount.",

    "Judgements In the process of applying the Consolidated Entity’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: Determining the lease term of contracts with renewal and termination options - Consolidated Entity as lessee The Consolidated Entity determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.",

    "That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise either the renewal or termination.",
    "After the commencement date, the Consolidated Entity reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew or to terminate (e.g.",
    "construction of significant leasehold improvements or significant customisation to the leased asset).",
    "The Consolidated Entity included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases with shorter non-cancellable period (i.e.",
    "three to five years).",
    "The Consolidated Entity typically exercises its option to renew for these leases because there will be a significant negative effect on production if a replacement asset is not readily available.",
    "The renewal periods for leases with longer non-cancellable periods (i.e.",
    "10 to 15 years) are not included as part of the lease term as these are not reasonably certain to be exercised.",
    "Furthermore, the periods covered by termination options are included as part of the lease term only when they are reasonably certain not to be exercised.",
    "Joint venture arrangements in which the Consolidated Entity holds 100% shareholding The Consolidated Entity considers that it has joint control in Genex (Kidston Wind) Pty Ltd and Bulli Creek Hold Co.",
    "Pty Ltd, even though it holds 100% of the total issued ordinary shares in each entity.",
    "This determination is derived from the joint development agreements that have been established for KS5W and BCP.",
    "These agreements stipulate that material decisions relating to project development activities require Unanimous consent from the contractual parties sharing control, with each party maintaining an equal 50% economic interest in the respective arrangements.",
    "The assessments made in respect of these entities has involved evaluating the substance of contractual arrangements, joint control, rights and obligations of the parties involved, as well as the nature and extent of their decision-making rights.",
    "Estimates and assumptions The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are described below.",
    "The Consolidated Entity has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.",
    "Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Consolidated Entity.",

    "This includes reviewing significant changes that may have an adverse effect on the Consolidated Entity.",
    "The performance of non-current assets is impacted by environmental, technological, market, economic, legal or environmental changes in which the Consolidated Entity operates.",
    "The significant judgements, estimates and assumptions applied by management when testing for impairment includes forecast electricity and LGC prices, generation profiles, marginal loss factors and discount rates.",
    "Provision for expected credit losses of trade and other receivables The Consolidated Entity uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade and other receivables.",
    "The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e.",
    "by geography, product type, customer type and rating, coverage by letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance).",
    "The provision matrix is initially based on the Consolidated Entity’s historical observed default rates.",
    "The Consolidated Entity will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.",
    "For example, if forecast economic conditions (i.e.",
    "gross domestic product) are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the manufacturing sector, the historical default rates are adjusted.",
    "At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.",
    "The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs isa significant estimate.",
    "The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions.",
    "The Consolidated Entity’s historical credit loss experience and consensus forecast economic conditions may also not be representative of a customer's actual default in the future.",
    "Leases - Estimating the incremental borrowing rate If the Consolidated Entity cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in a lease, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities.",
    "The IBR is the rate of interest that the Consolidated Entity would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right- of-use asset in a similar economic environment.",
    "The IBR therefore reflects what the Consolidated Entity ‘would have to pay’, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available (such as for subsidiaries that do not enter into financing transactions) or when they need to be adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (for example, when leases are not in the subsidiary’s functional currency).",
    "Where required to do so, the Consolidated Entity estimates the IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest rates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates (such as the subsidiary’s stand-alone credit rating).",

    "This estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option or appreciation right, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.",
    "For the measurement of the fair value of equity-settled transactions with employees at the grant date, the Consolidated Entity uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model, the Binomial Option Pricing Tree and or the Monte-Carlo Statistical Scenario Analysis.",
    "The assumptions and models used for estimating the fair value of share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 9.",
    "Taxes Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised.",
    "Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits, together with future tax planning strategies.",
    "The Consolidated Entity has $63,600,949 (30 June 2022: $50,636,551) of tax losses carried forward.",
    "These losses relate to subsidiaries that have a history of losses, do not expire, and may not be used to offset taxable income elsewhere in the Consolidated Entity.",
    "The subsidiaries neither have any taxable temporary difference nor any tax planning opportunities available that could partly support the recognition of these losses as deferred tax assets.",
    "On this basis, the Consolidated Entity has determined that it cannot recognise deferred tax assets on the tax losses carried forward.",
    "Further details on taxes are disclosed in Note 12.",
    "Fair value measurement of financial instruments When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model methodology.",
    "The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values.",
    "Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.",
    "Changes in assumptions relating to these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.",
    "See Note 23 for further disclosures.",
    "Development costs The Consolidated Entity capitalises costs for project development.",
    "Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management's Judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed, usually when a project development has reached a defined milestone according to an established project management model.",

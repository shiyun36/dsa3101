    "In turn, the Board of Directors has appointed Flavio Cattaneo as Chief Executive Officer.",
    "The new management has defined the Group's strategy, based on three pillars: (i) Profitability, flexibility and resilience through selective capital allocation aiming at maximizing the Group’s return while minimizing risk; (ii) Efficiency and effectiveness through the simplification of activities and processes, a leaner organization with clear accountability and a focus on core geographies in which the Group has an integrated position (Italy, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and the United States) in order to maximize cash generation and compensate for inflationary dynamics and rising cost of capital: (iii) Financial and environmental sustainability to pursue value creation strengthening the financial structure, while addressing the challenges of climate change.",
    "Sustainability Report 2023 Flavio Cattaneo Chief Executive Officer and General Manager In 2023, Enel is confirmed as the world’s largest private operator in the renewable energy sector, with 63 GW of managed capacity (including BESS), and in the energy distribution sector, with over 70 million end users connected to the grids.",
    "Furthermore, it is the private company with the largest customer base, amounting to over 61 million people, to whom it supplies energy and related services.",
    "The Group continues to pursue the decarbonization roadmap in line with limiting global warming to below 1.5 °C: in 2023, absolute direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions along the entire value chain, amounting to 94.3 MtCO,.: were reduced by 26.3% compared to 2022, in line with the decarbonization targets for 2030 and 2040, as certified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).",
    "In 2023, Enel also confirmed the technological leadership in generation from renewable sources, storage systems, and distribution networks.",
    "In the energy distribution sector, Enel continues to modernize and digitalize electricity grids, both to enhance their resilience to increasingly extreme weather events and to prepare them Claicl' to play the role of enablers of the energy transition.",
    "The push for innovation will continue to be a strategic driver.",
    "The Group will continue to monitor the evolution of new technologies that will mature in the medium-long term, such as hydrogen and the new small and modular fission or fusion nuclear reactors.",
    "Enel is also leading the path of energy transition and electrification of consumption through the development of a portfolio of products and services dedicated to residential consumers, businesses, and municipalities.",
    "In the countries where it operates, Enel recognizes the importance of building strong and positive relationships with all stakeholders, from local communities to governments.",
    "Continuous dialogue with these stakeholders makes it possible to carry out projects that respond to common priorities and needs and allow the creation of sustainable and shared value.",
    "People and human capital play a central role in leading the change and the achievement of strategic objectives.",
    "More than 61,000 people (about 23% are women), 79 different nationalities in 38 countries, 4 generations working together, all demonstrate how diversity and 3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis 4 Performance 2023 inclusion are a fundamental prerequisite for a sustainable company.",
    "Enel pays constant attention to people's training and to the enhancing of talents, promoting growth paths based on merit.",
    "Another key element is the more than 8,300 qualified suppliers, with whom the Group shares the goal of creating sustainable processes, capable of maximizing economic, social, and environmental benefits, in the knowledge that it is necessary to minimize the need for critical raw materials through innovation and circular economy.",
    "Enel also maintains vigilant and constant attention to safety in the workplaces: safety is not only a corporate objective but a commitment to mutual responsibility between the Company, workers, and suppliers.",
    "In order to promote a shared and acted culture, Enel has launched a global communication campaign on safety issues.",
    "To conclude, the Group is determined to create value for all stakeholders, contributing to the energy transition, the electrification of consumption, and the fight against climate change.",
    "Enel from now on 5 Appendix fa 8 Sustainability Report 2023 CNC The global context in which the Group operates has been characterized over the past 12 months by interlocking events that have caused turmoil at all levels.",
    "In addition to the post-pandemic geopolitical events, there was a signif- icant rise in interest rates and inflation with a correspond- ing downward revision of GDP growth in many countries.",
    "Moreover, the prolonged military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the more recent conflict in the Middle East, the unstable relationship between the US and China, and the resulting uncertainty on a global scale continued to exacerbate energy, raw materials and food markets, slow- ing the process of normalizing inflationary pressures on a global scale.",
    "At the same time, the state of the art of the Paris Agreement targets calls for an acceleration of the energy transition to limit the increase in average global warming to within 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels.",
    "At the recent COP 28 on climate change held in Dubai, a target was set to transition away gradually from fossil fuels by 2050 and to triple renewable capacity by 2030 (11 TW vs 3.6 TW in 2022).",
    "The path towards achieving the UN Sustainable Devel- opment Goals is significantly behind, with only 15% cur- rently on track, due to various interconnected crises and tensions.",
    "In response, the UN Global Compact launched the “Forward Faster” campaign in September 2023, urg- ing companies to accelerate their efforts, particularly in Climate action, Finance and investment, Water resilience, Gender equality and Living wage.",
    "Governments and regulators have well understood the need to pursue ever greater energy independence through energy generated from renewable sources.",
    "This is a context in which the role of distribution networks will be crucial in meeting demand and accommodating new capacity from renewables, along with that of energy stor- age systems, which in turn will be crucial in ensuring not only the penetration of renewables, but also a stable and reliable supply.",
    "Climate, human rights and just transition are global pri- orities for action.",
    "Tackling the climate crisis has significant social impacts, and the imperatives of a just transition and respect for human rights must be taken into account in business practices, as reaffirmed by the Paris Agreement and COP 28, putting people at the center to ensure sup- port and engagement.",
    "Sustainability Report 2023 2 For further details see the chapters “Zero emissions ambition and just transition” and “Managing human rights’ of this Report.",
    "There is also a growing focus on issues related to nature and in particular biodiversity.",
    "The recently announced commitment at the World Economic Forum to start mak- ing nature-related disclosures, building on the Recom- mendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) published in September 2023, under- lines the crucial turning point on this topic for the private sector and reiterates the importance of considering the synergies between people, nature and climate.",
    "In line with this trend, even leading ESG ratings demand commit- ments from companies on biodiversity conservation.",
    "Digitalization driven by artificial intelligence offers oppor- tunities and challenges, eliciting responses from regula- tors, but also raises concerns about the ethics of artificial intelligence and its implications for the workforce.",
    "Consid- ering the growing need to ensure that artificial intelligence is used responsibly and safely, the European Union has approved a draft law on the subject that would regulate the use of large language models and generative artificial intelligence.",
    "Finally, mandatory sustainability reporting, spearheaded by the European CSRD (Corporate Social Responsibili- ty Directive) and the International Sustainability Standard Board, is progressively imposing itself globally, requiring increasing cooperation and collaboration between the various institutions and regulators in different countries.",
    "The various regulations and mandatory requirements are, however, faced with the growing risk of anti-ESG senti- ment, which may delay their adoption in some regional contexts.",
    "The sustainability landscape is constantly evolving and, in order to meet challenges and seize opportunities, constant monitoring of trends is required along with joint action by the different stakeholders to weigh up needs while aiming at sustainable progress.",
    "Companies can play a crucial role by promoting a fair and sustainable transition through con- crete and credible commitments in line with the context.",

    "The reduction in the economic value generated directly is mainly related to the decrease in sales revenues of energy commodities, in par- ticular gas and electricity, due to both the lower quantities brokered in the wholesale and retail markets and the re- duction in average prices.",
    "The decrease in operating costs is mainly due to the re- duction in energy and gas purchase costs due to the de- crease in volumes and average prices, as well as the drop in costs for transportation and CO, quotas.",

    "The Framework is based on two essential principles: the “risk-based approach” and “cyber security by design’.",
    "The first requires cyber risk assessment to be a prerequisite for strategic decisions and for the development and secure maintenance of all assets of the organization (e.g., people, infrastructure, platforms, and technology solutions).",
    "The second, cyber security by design, ensures that cyber security principles are adopted from the outset and throughout the entire lifecycle of solutions, services and infrastructure in all areas: IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology) and lof (Internet of Things).",
    "This approach is essential in an environment marked by the widespread implementation of digital tools and solutions, which are fundamental to enhancing the entire system but which also continually present new challenges.",
    "Therefore, although the Enel Group is strongly committed to measures to strengthen the “Cyber Security Posture”, there is an awareness that cyber risk is strongly characterized and influenced by exogenous, unpredictable factors, such as cyber attacks, which are increasingly frequent and sophisticated and which could negatively affect business operations, even with defensive processes and technologies.",
    "Increased production costs due to excessive volatility or rising costs of raw materials ave Enel carries out monitoring and forecasting activities to simulate and test business initiatives Under different price scenarios.",
    "Moreover, to manage price risk, Enel adopts hedging strategies and strategically manages suppliers in order to be proactive negotiators.",
    "Higher costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and monetary exchange rates, as well as rising inflation The macroeconomic landscape has changed rapidly, with prolonged periods of elevated interest rates, diminished economic growth prospects, and a swiftly rising cost of capital.",
    "In light of these exogenous factors, the Enel Group is focusing on flexibility and resilience, cost efficiency, and competitiveness.",
    "Lower revenues due to poor customer reten- tion and satisfaction due to low quality ser- vice delivery am Enel has implemented several tools to measure customer satisfaction, including transactional, relational, and in-app surveys.",
    "After analyzing the results, concrete actions are put in place based on customer feedback, which aim to resolve critical issues and boost satisfaction and loyalty over time.",
    "“Close the loop” is one example of an initiative that investigates the causes of negative feedback on customer satisfaction surveys so as to resolve any dissatisfaction and prevent further issues in the future.",
    "Inadequate initiatives from institutions to help accelerate the energy transition (includ- ing excessive bureaucracy), which results in uncertainty and slowdowns for the Compa- ny's investment in renewable and low-carbon technologies Energy transition trends are not the same in all countries.",
    "With regard to the spread of renewable energy sources, the penetration of electric vehicles and the adoption of green hydrogen, there are often poor or ineffective support mechanisms along with unsuitable market structures.",
    "The Enel Group's strategic development guidelines were drawn up taking into consideration the evolving external environment, the regulatory and normative framework, and the competitive landscape.",
    "At the same time, Enel takes a transparent, collaborative and proactive approach to institutions and local regulators in order to promote initiatives and regulations that support the energy transition.",
    "Lower revenues due to low uptake of ener- gy-efficient products and services as a result of the absence or inadequacy of the regula- tory framework of incentives and regulations am For Enel, the regulatory framework of incentives and regulations is crucial to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the European Community, which tie in with its own business objectives for decarbonizing customers.",
    "Achieving these goals requires a clear and favorable regulatory framework, which provides incentives for the installation of renewable energy generation equipment, private charging stations, products for energy efficiency, and thermal insulation, while any shortcomings could put their achievement at risk.",

    "To support its analysis of scenarios and of the external context, the Group identifies and analyzes short-, medi- um- and long-term trends to develop an overview of how structural forces and current macro-trends influence the speed of transition and the expected impacts in the ener- gy sector and in particular in the businesses in which Enel operates.",
    "This trend mapping provides a basis for defining actions to orient the positioning of the business, seizing opportunities in the sector.",

    "IMPACT ASSESSMENT 104 Sustainability Report 2023 Enel’s scenarios are based on an overall framework so as to ensure consistency between the energy transition sce- nario and the physical climate scenario: e the “energy transition scenario” describes how the generation and consumption of energy evolves in var- ious sectors in a specific economic, social, policy and regulatory context; e issues concerning future trends in climate variables (in terms of frequency and intensity of acute and chronic phenomena) define the so-called “physical scenario”.",
    "In order to assess the effects of transition and physical phenomena on the energy system, the Group relies on in- ternal models that describe the energy system for each country under analysis, taking into consideration specific technological, social-economic, policy and regulatory as- pects.",
    "The process that translates the scenario phenomena into information that is useful for industrial and strategic deci- sions can be summarized in five steps: 1 Identification of trends and factors relevant to the a business (eg., electrification of consumption, heat waves, etc.) 2 Development of link functions connecting climate/ a transition scenarios and operating variables 3 Identification of risks = and opportunities 4 Calculation of impacts on business a (eg., change in performance, losses, Capex) 5 Strategic actions: definition and implementation a (eg., capital allocation, resilience plans) Claicl' Enel’s energy transition scenarios The energy transition scenario details how the generation and consumption of energy evolve in a certain geopolitical, macroeconomic, regulatory and competitive context, de- pending on the available technology options; it correlates with a greenhouse gas emission trend and climate scenar- io and, consequently, a specific temperature increase by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial values.",
    "The main assumptions considered in defining Enel’s ener- gy transition scenarios concern the macroeconomic and energy context, regulatory policies and measures, and the evolution, costs and adoption of energy generation, con- version and consumption technologies.",
    "The Group’s reference scenario for planning is a Par- is-aligned scenario, which envisages achieving the tem- perature goals of the Paris Agreement, namely, a rise in the global average temperature below 2 °C compared to pre-industrial levels, and therefore anticipating a higher level of climate ambition than business as usual, but with- out necessarily assuming that the Net Zero emissions tar- get will be reached by 2050, considering the current level of overall ambition at a global level and the slowdown in the speed of the energy transition that the current mac- roeconomic and energy environment is causing locally on some transition variables.",
    "Assumptions on commodity price trends in inputs to the Reference scenario consider a sustained increase in the price of CO,,, caused by the gradual reduction of allowanc- es supply in the face of growing demand, and a sharp fall in coal prices, due to decreasing demand, are expected by 2030.",
    "With regard to gas, it is believed that price ten- sions will ease in the coming years in light of a realignment between supply and demand at a global level.",
    "Finally, oil prices are expected to stabilize gradually, for which it is estimated that demand will peak around 2030.",
    "3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis 4 Performance 2023 In order to assess risks and opportunities related to the energy transition, alternative scenarios were defined with respect to the reference scenario, depending on the de- gree of climate ambition assumed globally and locally: e “Slower Transition”, a scenario in which a more medi- um-term approach is taken to the slowdown observ- able in the short term in some countries and regions.",
    "In this scenario, fuel demand will peak more gradually, and this will support energy commodity prices; e “Accelerated Transition”, a scenario in which there is an increase in ambition compared to the Reference scenario, particularly with regard to certain variables.",
    "It envisages, on the one hand, an acceleration of decar- bonization, driven by regulation, and at the same time a more rapid decrease in demand for fossil fuels, which inevitably will result in lower prices for these commod- ities in 2030.",
    "With respect to the full achievement of the Paris Agree- ment to stabilize the global average temperature to with- in +1.5 °C, the doubt persists that some countries might continue to take a sluggish approach and fail to adopt effective measures to reduce their emissions in a timely manner, thereby delaying the process of decarbonization toward net zero emissions by 2050.",
    "Despite this, Enel op- erates a business model in line with the highest ambition of Paris Agreement objectives, namely, one that is con- sistent with a global average temperature increase of 1.5 °C by 2100 as certified by the Science Based Targets ini- tiative (SBTi).",
    "pa scenarios (Italy, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia), see the “Group Strategy and Risk Management’ section of the 2023 Integrated Annual Report.",
    "For more information on local transition Zero emissions ambition and just transition 5 Appendix Climate change is playing an increasingly prominent role in these scenarios, with impacts not only on the transition of the economy towards Net Zero emissions, but also physical impacts that can be divided into: e acute phenomena, namely short-term but rather in- tense phenomena such as floods, hurricanes, etc., with potential impacts on assets (such as damage and business interruptions); e chronic phenomena related to structural changes in the climate, such as the rising trend in temperatures, rising sea levels etc., which can cause, for example, constant changes in the output of generation plants and in electricity consumption profiles in the residen- tial and commercial sectors.",
    "Such phenomena are analyzed by looking at how they will behave in the future: this is done by selecting the best available data from the output data of climate models at various levels of resolution, as well as historical data.",
    "Among the climatic projections developed by the “In- tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change” (IPCC) on a global scale, the Group has chosen three that are in line with those taken into account in the latest IPCC report as part of the sixth assessment cycle (AR6).",
    "Such scenari- Os are associated with emission patterns that are linked to a level of the so-called Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP), each one being related to one of five so- cial and economic scenarios that the scientific commu- nity defines as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP).",
    "The SSP scenarios include general assumptions such as those on population, urbanization, and so on.",
    "The three physical scenarios considered by the Group are as fol- lows: e SSP1-RCP 2.6: compatible with a global warming range below 2 °C, compared with pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) by 2100 (the IPCC projects approximately +1.8 °C on average over the 1850-1900 period); the Group associates the SSP1-RCP 2.6 scenario with the Reference and Accelerated Transition scenarios in analyses that take into account both physical variables and transition variables; e SSP2-RCP 4.5: compatible with an intermediate sce- nario, in which an average temperature increase of around 2.7 °C is expected by 2100 when compared with the 1850-1900 period.",
    "The RCP 4.5 scenario best represents the current global climate and political context and the associated transition assumptions.",
    "This scenario projects global warming as being con- sistent with the estimated temperature increase that takes into account current global policies: the Group associates the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario with the Slower Transition scenario in analyses that take into account both physical variables and transition variables; e SSP5-RCP 8.5: compatible with a scenario where no particular measures are taken to combat climate change.",
    "According to this scenario, the global tem- perature is estimated to increase by around +4.4 °C, compared to pre-industrial levels, by 2100.",
    "The Group sees the RCP 8.5 scenario as a worst-case Cli- mate scenario, which is used for assessing the effects of physical ohenomena in acontext in which climate change is particularly severe, but is not considered likely at pres- ent.",
    "The RCP 2.6 scenario is used for the assessment of physical phenomena and for analyses that consider an energy transition that is in line with the most ambitious mitigation targets.",
    "Climate scenarios are global in nature.",
    "Accordingly, in order to determine the effects in the areas of relevance for the Group, they must be analyzed locally.",
    "The Group’s active partnerships include an ongoing collaboration with the Department of Geosciences of the International Cen- tre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste.",
    "As part of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the main climate variables with a grid resolution that varies from approximately 12 km to approximately 100 km on the side and a time horizon of 2020-2050.",
    "The main variables are temperature, rainfall and snowfall, and solar radiation.",
    "In this phase of the study, the future projections were analyzed for Italy, Spain and all countries of interest to the Group in South America, Central America and North America, obtaining, also due to the use of the ensemble of models, a more definite representation of the physi- cal scenario.",

    "It is estimated that any residual emissions remaining in 2040, in any case unrelated to direct emissions from power generation and indirect emissions from the sale of electricity and gas where all emissions are expected to be zero, will amount to less than 2.5 MtCO,,, annually.",
    "In this case, to achieve the target of net zero emissions validat- ed by the SBTi, from 2040 onward the Group will mitigate any impact by removing carbon equivalent volumes from the atmosphere, primarily by building a portfolio of car- bon removal credits linked to high-quality, high-integrity nature-based and technology-based solutions with prov- en long-term durability, managing potential risks through portfolio diversification by technology and country.",
    "In line with the Group’s commitment to a just transition, action is being taken with regard to the requalification, retraining and self-learning of direct and indirect work- ers, the provision of support to supply chain companies to help business diversification and strengthen resilience, the creation of value for communities in terms of access to local job opportunities, and the facilitation of access to products and services for customers.",

    "For the 2024-2026 period, the Group has outlined an am- bitious total gross investment plan of approximately 35.8 billion euros, strategically spread across different countries and regions with 49% destined for Italy, 25% to Spain, 19% to Latin America, and the remaining 7% to North America.",
    "Regarding renewables, the Group has planned gross in- vestments of approximately 12.1 billion euros between 2024 and 2026, and it specifically plans to invest in on- shore wind, solar, and battery storage (BESS).",
    "The Group's new approach to investment in renewables is based on three different business models: e an Ownership business model, in which the Group holds a 100% stake, which will be applied mainly in Italy and Iberia; e aPartnership business model, in which the Group holds a 50% stake (and less than 100%); e a Stewardship business model, in which the Group holds a stake of 50% or less, which will continue to apply in the non-core countries of the Group.",
    "Between 2024 and 2026, this new approach is expect- ed to enable the Group to create about 13.4 GW of new renewable capacity in all countries and regions where it operates.",
    "In 2026, the Group expects its consolidated and managed renewable capacity to increase to approximately 73 GW from about 62 GW in 2023 (55.5 GW of consolidat- ed capacity and 6.2 GW of managed capacity), with the share of consolidated and managed generation with zero emissions reaching around 86%, up from 75% in 2023.",
    "In addition, regarding the decarbonization process, the plan is to gradually reduce investments in new carbon-in- tensitve assets until they get to zero in 2025.",
    "Specifically, in 2024-2026, the Group plans to invest less than 3% of gross investment in thermoelectric power generation, largely dedicated to maintaining existing plants, while investment in new plant development will be substantially limited to the conversion from coal to CCGT power at the Fusina power plant, which is scheduled for completion by 2024.",
    "Regarding grids, the Group plans to invest around 18.6 bil- lion euros over the 2024-2026 period.",
    "Grid investment is expected to focus on improvements in quality, resilience to the effects of climate change, and digitalization, as well as on new connections.",
    "As for customers, the Group has planned gross invest- ments of approximately 3 billion euros between 2024 and 2026 that, among other priorities, will also help promote the electrification of consumption, supporting customers in the decarbonization process.",
    "More than 90% of the gross capital expenditure in 2024- 2026 is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Devel- opment Goals (SDG), directly pursuing SDG 7 (“Affordable and clean energy’), 9 (“Industry, innovation and infrastruc- ture”) and 11 (“Sustainable cities and communities”), which are all related to SDG 18 (“Climate action’).",
    "The invest- ments envisaged in the Group's Strategic Plan are in line with the decarbonization and greenhouse gas reduction targets, based on a specific methodology whereby invest- ments made in renewables and retail power inherently fall under SDG 7 investments in the distribution network fall under SDG 9, and investments in Enel X are related to SDG 11.",
    "Therefore, the over 90% referred to above does not in- clude investments in conventional generation (including investments in maintenance) and in retail gas.",
    "In addition, over 80% of the Group's investments in the 2024-2026 period will be aligned with the EU Taxonomy criteria, as they will make a substantial contribution to cli- mate change mitigation.",

    "In the Enel (Reference) scenario, the progressive electrifi- cation of final energy consumption — particularly of trans- portation and the residential sector — leads to a consider- able increase in electricity consumption and thus growth in the demand for electricity.",
    "This dynamic reduces the risk arising from the gradual increase of renewables in the energy mix, which could lead to a reduction in the whole- sale electricity price; moreover, market design revisions that favor long-term remuneration would have a positive impact in terms of the greater visibility of returns in the medium and long term.",
    "The effects of the Slower Transition and Accelerated Tran- sition scenarios on the variables most likely to impact the business have therefore been identified, in particular elec- tricity demand, influenced by the dynamics of electrifi- cation of consumption, and thus penetration of electric technologies and the electricity generation mix.",
    "With regard to the electrification of consumption, the Slower Transition scenario predicts lower penetration rates of the most efficient electric technologies, partic- ularly electric cars and heat pumps, causing a decrease in electric demand compared to the Reference scenario, which is estimated to result in moderate impacts on the Retail commodity business & beyond.",

    "As regards the Accelerated Transition scenario, a more rapid reduction in the cost of green hydrogen generation technologies is assumed.",
    "This results in increased pene- tration of this energy carrier, at the expense of blue and gray hydrogen, with a consequent additive effect on do- mestic electricity demand and renewable capacity instal- lations compared to the Reference scenario.",
    "All scenarios, albeit to a greater extent the Reference and Accelerated Transition scenarios, envisage an increasing- ly important role for grids: indeed, a significant increase is expected in distributed generation and in other re- sources, such as storage systems, greater penetration of electric mobility with the relative charging infrastructures, as well as the increasing rate of the electrification of con- sumption.",
    "This context will involve a decentralization of the extraction/feed-in points, an increase in electric de- mand and the average requested power, a considerable variation in energy flows, which will require dynamic and flexible grid management.",
    "The Group therefore expects that in this scenario incremental investments will be nec- essary to guarantee the connections and suitable levels of quality and resilience, by promoting the adoption of innovative operating models.",

    "Accordingly, the Group has already implemented the following methodological changes that affect the data for the 2021-2023 period, while further actions will be developed during 2024: e for the calculation of Scope 2 and Scope 3 - category 3D emissions (generation of purchased electricity that is sold to end users), the country emission factors of the power system (for both location-based and mar- ket-based models) have been updated.",
    "Enel now relies on data from national authorities for its core countries (Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Brazil and the United States), while continuing to use data from third-party providers for all other countries; e for the calculation of Scope 2 emissions relating to electricity consumption in power distribution business, it has been decided to consider these emissions as part of the calculation of scope 2 emissions from technical grid losses; e for the calculation of Scope 3 - category 1 emissions (purchase of goods and services), primary data and method calculation on specific works have been up- dated; e for the calculation of Scope 3 - category 11 emissions (use of sold products), Enel updated the methodology to align the calorific value considered for the natural gas volume sold to end customers with the corresponding IPCC factor.",

    "They are calculated us- ing reliable secondary data for each specific phase (from the extraction phase to gas distribution) in line with IPCC factors, and are part of the previously disclosed data on Scope 3 emissions from upstream fuels.",
    "All direct and indirect emissions from methane leaks and fuel combustion in the Group's power plants and all indi- rect emissions related to the natural gas retail business will be fully mitigated by 2040, when the Group com- pletes the divestment of all its thermoelectric capacity and gas retail business.",
    "Worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continued to increase in 2023, largely due to the economic rebound and a further increase in fossil fuel consumption, with the energy crisis and high natural gas and liquefied natural gas prices triggering an increased use of unabated coal as a cheaper but more emissive fuel.",
    "The Group, however, managed to reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions across its entire value chain by 26.3% overall, compared to the previous year.",
    "In addition, the Group, it also reduced its Scope 1 GHG emissions In- tensity relating to Power Generation by more than 30.1%, from 229 gCO,,,/KWh in 2022 down to 160 gCO,,./KWh in 2023.",
    "Such reduction is the result of a 12.9% increase in consolidated production from renewable sources and a 375% reduction in consolidated production from ther- moelectric sources compared to 2022, as a consequence of the Group's strategy of shifting its energy mix portfolio towards renewables and to advancing in its decarboniza- tion process.",

    "126 Sustainability Report 2023 Claicl' Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine and the consequent re- strictions in EU gas imports from Russia, which caused a decrease in gas availability accompanied by a surge in the wholesale prices of electricity and gas with severe effects for households and businesses, led the EU governments to implement a range of policy responses to mitigate the impact of higher costs and ensure the energy system's stability.",
    "In particular, the Italian government responded with a na- tional natural gas consumption containment plan that in- cluded, among its measures, the maximization of electrici- ty generation in the thermoelectric sector using fuels oth- er than gas.",
    "This was achieved through Decree 14/2022, which required the country’s national transmission system operator (TSO) to define a program aimed at maximizing power generation from coal-fired power plants until the end of September 2023.",
    "Consequently, the TSO identified Enel's coal-fired power plants as essential and required them to maximize their production.",
    "On the other hand, in Spain, the government authorization for the closure of As Pontes coal power plant requested by Enel’s subsidiary Endesa in December 2019 for June 2021 was postponed until the end of 2023 as the power plant was identified as essential by the transmission system op- erator.",
    "As aconsequence of the unprecedented crisis that the Eu- ropean energy system faced in 2022 and 2023, the Group's emission reduction carried out in 2023 was not enough to meet the Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity target relating to Power Generation set for 2023 and announced at the Cap- ital Markets Day held in November 2020 for the launch of the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan.",
    "Due to the energy crisis, the intensity figure stood slightly higher than the target of 148 gCO,,,,/ kWh.",
    "In the absence of the above-mentioned ef- fect, Enel would have been able to achieve a level of emis- sion intensity well below the target of 148 gCO,,./ kWh.",
    "As a consequence, the Group's sustainability-linked in- struments which set the Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity target relating to Power Generation of 148 gCO,,,/KWh for 2023 will be subject to an increase of the relevant mar- gin and Enel will comply with its obligations in accordance with the terms and conditions of the legal documentation of such Sustainability-Linked transactions.",
    "Despite these unprecedented circumstances, the Group’s emissions intensity in 2023 remained in line with the 1.5 °C pathway.",
    "In fact, the sector's decarbonization approach of the SBTi established a maximum threshold of 246 gCo,,,/KWh for Enel for 2023, well above the ac- tual figure.",
    "3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis 4 Performance 2023 Ultimately, Enel’s commitment to decarbonization remains confirmed for the short, medium and long term, as envis- aged in the new 2024-2026 Strategic Plan, which estab- lishes a new short-term target for 2026 of 125 gCO,,,/KWh.",
    "This new target has been included in the Sustainability Linked Financing Framework updated in January 2024 and linked to the first launch of sustainability-linked bonds in 2024, con- firming Enel’s commitment to the energy transition as well as contributing to the environmental and financial sustainability of the Group's development strategy.",
    "Furthermore, the tar- get for 2030 to reduce 80% of the Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation with respect to the 2017 baseline and the final target for 2040 aimed at reducing 100% of these emissions without relying on any type of offset or carbon removal mechanism remain confirmed as well.",

    "Assessing impacts, dependencies and risks The identification of potential impact factors on nature and biodiversity is fundamental for Enel in order to define the most effective strategies to avoid, minimize, remedi- ate or compensate for the associated impacts, in line with the provisions of the Mitigation Hierarchy included in the Group’s Environmental Policy.",
    "Similarly, the identification of dependencies on natural capital and biodiversity makes it possible to identify the most appropriate strategies to reduce the related risks to the Company.",
    "For the management of impacts and dependencies also with reference to the entire value chain, Enel has adopted a combined and progressive approach, aimed primarily at evaluating those related to direct activities in operational assets as well as in the design and construction of new assets and subsequently to the procurement of goods in the supply chain.",
    "Specifically: e as regards direct activities in operating assets, a basic investigation was carried out with data from the utility sector, aimed at defining materiality matrices for each technology relevant for the Group, identifying priori- ty investigation sites (hotspots) by cross-referencing with the site-specific characteristics of the asset, and performing a preliminary qualitative assessment of the levels of residual risk associated with each technology; e as regards siting and construction of new plants, eval- uations were undertaken with the aim of adopting unique evaluation criteria and specific objectives for No Net Loss and No Net Deforestation, as outlined in the paragraph “Enel’s commitment to biodiversity”; e as regards the supply chain, from procurement plans for equipment and plant components, an analysis was launched in 2023 to examine the corresponding raw materials and the impacts associated with their ex- traction and refinement, particularly affecting habitats and environmental matrices.",
    "The assessment of impacts, dependencies and risks, which are described in greater detail in the following para- graphs, was conducted in accordance with the general guidelines and recommendations for the energy sector developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and, where applicable, by the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN).",

    "The analysis, started in 2022 and continued in 2023 based on the re- sults of the above-described materiality analysis for im- pacts and dependencies, led to the identification for each technology of the main operational and economic-finan- cial risks expected for the Company, as well as social and environmental risks, and the identification of the main opportunities in relation to each relevant impact factor and dependency.",
    "This preliminary screening analysis led to the definition of an evaluation template for each tech- nology, in which the main critical events of physical type (both acute in the short-medium term and chronic in the long term) and of transitional type (resulting from possible changes in the regulatory, technological, reputational or market framework) were identified with also the main as- sociated risks and opportunities.",
    "Below is a summary of the main operational and econom- ic-financial risks identified as material for Enel in relation to the impact factors and dependencies specified above in line with TNFD recommendations: e reduction or interruption of generation capacity; e recovery and repair needs: e authorization delays; e adaptation and technological innovation needs: e additional insurance fees; e loss of competitiveness.",
    "At the same time, this screening phase made it possible to identify the following main opportunities: e improvement of environmental and sustainability per- formance, such as efficiency in the use of resources and initiatives for the protection, restoration and re- generation of natural habitats; e business opportunities, linked for example to the of- fer of nature-positive energy products and services, the launch of new partnerships in sustainable innova- tion sectors, access to green financing, and strategic choices of commitment and sector leadership, aimed at the economic, reputational and financial growth of the Company.",

    "In fact, for years Enel has already been defining specific im- provement targets that make it possible to mitigate the main risks associated with these impact factors in the future.",
    "The identified intervention priorities therefore relate to the control of risk associated with land occupation and the transformation of ecosystems, and particularly to the use of land and the transformation of terrestrial habitats, in rela- tion to which new commitments were made at Group level already last year (see the paragraph “Enel’s commitment to biodiversity’).",
    "Asset prioritization and IRO (Impact-Risk-Opportunity) analysis aggregated by technology During 2023 the Group moved from a sector analysis to a site-specific analysis aimed at prioritizing assets in operation by means of an IRO (Impacts-Risks-Opportunities) analysis for the different technologies® in the Group’s main coun- tries and therefore to the identification of sites (hotspots) on which to subsequently undertake local analysis of poten- tial impact characteristics.",
    "The ranking of assets was carried out based on the estimated corresponding level of potential impact exerted, which was evaluated starting from the local natural conditions and the site-specific value of one or more impact indicators specific to the plant technology, in accor- dance with the SBTN indications shown in the figure.",
    "Company’s impact — on nature Contribution to impact drivers (pressure) “State of nature” indicators The local natural conditions were evaluated starting from the biodiversity indicators already adopted by Enel (see the paragraph “Interaction of assets with biodiversity”) and, more specifically, based on the values of indicators (KPI) relating to the transformation of natural habitats and to the biodiversity significancy (presence of protected area, threatened species or critical habitats) in each of the assets, or to their presence in water-stressed areas.",
    "The significance of impact drivers was instead estimated by adopting threshold values for the main impact KPls of each technology, said KPls having been chosen based on the corresponding materiality matrix.",
    "In addition to sites with significant impact KPIs, sites deemed relevant were also added in the selection, based on evidence emerging from records relating to the various “Operational analysis and monitoring tools” adopted by the Company, such as records of Environmental Events, records of ECoS (Extra Checking on Site) Improvement Actions, and records of environmental risk analyses in the ISO 14001 management systems.",
    "This enabled the identification of hotspots, je.",
    "sites or ar- eas with operational plants or infrastructures that present the highest potential level of impact/risk, due to the simul- taneous occurrence of the established natural and impact conditions of significance.",
    "During 2024, these hotspots will be subject to a subsequent in-depth investigation under- taken according to the LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Pre- pare disclosure) methodology defined by the TNFD, to take into account the specific local context and the interaction of each technological asset with the local natural and biodiver- sity characteristics, as envisaged for the priority application of the IRO (Impacts-Risks-Opportunities) analysis to complex organizations.",
    "During 2023, based on the asset profling data described above, a preliminary impact/risk assessment was also car- ried out at corporate level.",
    "To this end, an internal meth- odology was developed that refers to the aggregate values of land occupied by the plants (in ha) of each technology in correspondence with the different levels of potential impact, evaluated based on the concomitant significance of one or more of the previous KPIs relating to natural and impact con- ditions.",
    "Based on the methodology adopted, an estimate of the inherent risk (IR) and the level of control exercised by the organization (C) was then carried out, thus arriving at the final assessment of residual risk (RR)\".",
    "In this preliminary phase of analysis at a qualitative level, a criterion of correspondence (1:1) between potential environmental impact and econom- ic-financial risk for the organization was adopted.",
    "(9) At the time it was not considered a priority to extend this phase of investigation to coal and nuclear technologies.",
    "Operational plants that adopt either of these technologies are subject to stringent impact assessment and environmental management requirements and controls by control bodies and compe- tent authorities.",
    "In line with the Group's strategies, a progressive closure or reconversion plan is also envisaged for these plants.",
    "(10) The following residual risk calculation formula is adopted: RR = IR x (1 — C), in which the inherent risk (IR) represents the potential risk in the absence of management control and prevention actions (C ) already implemented by the organization in order to mitigate the risk to residual risk (RR) values deemed acceptable.",

    "Starting from this data, the constituent raw materials were then determined (unprocessed and as processed/incorporated) along with their consumption.",
    "Through the use of public tools and da- tabases™, the analysis then focused on the impacts linked to the life cycle phases (LCA - Life Cycle Assessment) of extraction and refinement of the main raw materials iden- tified, phases which are recognized by SBTN guidelines as having the most significant potential impacts on nature.",
    "At the same time, an investigation was carried out on the relevant countries of origin of raw materials at global level, focusing on countries environmental performance (through indicators regarding protection of biodiversity and water resources, air quality, waste treatment, etc.) and on the av- erage recovery rates of materials in production processes.",
    "A preliminary qualitative assessment was then carried out on the impacts on nature linked to the main raw materials in the supply chain, which are potentially critical for the or- ganization from an environmental viewpoint, based on the following (qualitative) formula: Potential impact of raw material Priority of need x LCA impact indicator Fraction produced x Country ENV Performance The preliminary investigation conducted in 2023 will be updated in 2024 based on the new Industrial Plan and fur- ther revised and integrated based on specific information that will derive from the direct analysis of Enel’s main sup- ply chains and associated product environmental certifi- cates (EPD - Environmental Product Declaration), with the aim of building a qualitative-quantitative impact matrix that progressively integrates direct data with the public sector data used as the basis for the analysis.",

    "Roadmap towards natural capital conservation 5 Appendix Optimal waste management is a strategic objective of Enel's environmental policy, which results in a constant commitment to reducing waste generation, as well as to constantly devising new methods of reusing, recycling and recovering waste in the perspective of a circular economy of resources, in line with the principles indicated by the The target of reducing waste from new community standard ESRS E5 “Resource use and cir- cular economy”.",
    "These principles are further strengthened and integrated into Enel’s operations in the Group Guide- lines for Waste Management, which Enel has adopted in order to collect and share best management practices and rules developed within the Company.",
    "operational and maintenance activities For several years, Enel has been pursuing an important tar- get of reducing waste produced by direct, operational and maintenance (O&M — Operation and Maintenance) activ- ities carried out on its plants.",
    "The ongoing energy tran- sition and Enel’s strategic decision to progressively close its coal-fired thermal plants ahead of schedule by 2027 have already in recent years led to a drastic reduction in the quantities of waste produced by these plants, which once accounted for the majority of the Group's internal production.",
    "It is therefore envisaged that the production — and subsequent disposal — of ash from coal and gypsum from desulfurization will go to zero.",
    "Starting last year, the target of reducing waste production has been extended to a part of the value chain, namely O&M waste produced by contractors who, operating on behalf of Enel, generate waste which they manage under their own responsibility as producers, in compliance with applicable laws, authorizations and mandatory qualifica- tion and management compliance criteria regularly ver- ified by Enel as the contracting company.",
    "These mostly consist of excavated earth and rocks and inert materials from civil and road construction and demolition, which in some main countries, including Italy, are classified and managed as waste and entirely destined for recovery.",
    "This new adjustment of the target incorporates the prin- ciples of extended responsibility of the waste producer, as recommended by the recent EU standard ESRS E5 “Re- source use and circular economy’.",
    "It also makes it possible to highlight, in the context of the ongoing energy transi- tion, the growing role within the Company of the manage- 168 Sustainability Report 2023 ment of electricity distribution networks, service networks (for example, public lighting networks) and renewables plants.",
    "The target commits the Company to a 55% reduction in waste produced by direct and contracted O&M activities in 2030 compared with the base year 2017.",
    "WASTE PRODUCTION FROM O&M ACTIVITIES (Mt) 6.7 -55% vs 2017 3.0 2017 2023 2030 target Waste produced in 2023 amounted to 3.3 Mt (-51% down on 2017), a moderate decrease compared with 2022 (3.4 Mt), as a consequence of the reduced output of coal-fired thermoelectric plants.",

    "In particular, production of coal ash desulfuriza- tion and gypsum was respectively 0.66 Mt in 2023 (-35% vs 2022) and 0.08 Mt (-29% vs 2022).",
    "Hazardous waste amounted to a significantly smaller por- tion (0.07 Mt) of total waste produced, equal to 2%, which was slightly up on 2022 (0.06 Mt) as a consequence of non-routine maintenance interventions.",
    "A significant portion of this waste (0.02 Mt, corresponding to 29% of total hazardous waste) is represented by “TSD sludges” (TSD denotes DeSO, plant blowdown treatment), produced by the pre-washing of combustion fumes in coal-fired thermoelectric plants, aimed at subsequent- ly obtaining, in the desulfurization tower, gypsums that comply with standards for their reuse in the construction industry.",
    "Enel, for precautionary reasons and standardized management, has decided to classify these sludges as hazardous by origin, sending them to landfill.",
    "The quantity of sludges produced is therefore linked to the operation of coal plants.",
    "In 2022, the year in which coal-fired electricity production in Europe increased by approximately 7 TWh compared with 2021 owing to the geopolitical context and following various meteorological factors, sludges produc- tion increased by over 9,000 t compared with the previous year (in 2021 it was 10,300 t).",
    "In 2023 there was a slight decrease in sludges production of approximately 1,000 t compared with 2022.",
    "Furthermore, the gradual planned phase-out of coal plants over the next few years will allow the quantities of said sludges to be progressively reduced.",
    "A second important category of hazardous waste is ‘in- dustrial waste’, which in 2023 amounted to 0.03 Mt, equal to 43% of total hazardous waste.",
    "This waste is essentially end-of-life equipment, originating mainly from the main- tenance and renewal of power grids and which is almost 1.8% 1.2% 2.0% 36.3% entirely sent for recovery (78%).",
    "The remaining portion (0.02 Mt, equal to 28%) mainly con- sists of oils, as well as earth and rocks that are classified as hazardous.",
    "The total quantity of hazardous waste sent for disposal in 2023 was 0.036 Mt, which is substantially similar to 2022 (0.034 Mt), and mainly the result of non-routine mainte- nance of some thermoelectric plants and modernization of power grids.",
    "The overall percentage of O&M waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous, sent for recovery totaled 85%.",
    "The commitment to a continuous increase in the percentage of waste recovered is essential for an effective transition towards a circular economy that minimizes the exploitation of natural resources, in accordance with the objectives of sustainable development and reducing the Company's en- vironmental impact and dependence on ecosystem ser- vices.",
    "Excavated earth and rocks (96%) and construction and demolition waste from O&M activities (89%) were recovered almost in their entirety, deriving mainly from the maintenance of power grids as well as of generation plants.",
    "Process waste from thermoelectric generation was also recovered to a significant extent, including coal ash and desulfurization gypsum, which were reused in construction industry to produce cement, concrete and bricks according to specific technical and environmental control requirements.",
    "In particular, the percentage sent for recovery was 75% for coal ash and 88% for desulfuriza- tion gypsum, slightly down on the previous year (respec- tively 80.4% and 88.3% in 2022).",
    "Finally, industrial waste, WEEE and metal waste, including iron, copper and alumi- num, deriving from the maintenance of generation plants and power grids was mainly destined for recovery (90%).",

    "Above all, these activities are linked to the generation of inert materials, such as excavated earth and rocks, as well as valuable metal waste, in the case of the end-of-life decommissioning of plants.",
    "Enel is constantly committed to maximizing their recovery.",
    "In particular, for the recovery of waste deriving from the end-of-life decom- missioning of plants, selective demolition techniques of the structures and dedicated management procedures are ad- opted to maximize their economic valorization.",
    "In 2023, waste produced on the construction sites of new renewable plants (wind and solar) and by the 3Sun giga- factory totaled 0.165 Mt, which consisted almost exclu- sively of non-hazardous waste (99.7%).",

    "This practice enables specific cloths to be repeatedly reused, as well as reconditioned to their original absorbent function through controlled washing operations.",
    "The companies producing the reusable technical cloths not only rent them out, but also collect them back and wash them after use.",
    "A high level of control is ensured in each phase by making the cloths identifiable by means of a special indelible mark and providing evidence as to the correct management of wastewater resulting from the various washes.",
    "The renting and reuse of the cloths makes it possible to reduce their production and the disposal to landfill of often hazardous waste (around 10-20 t/year of waste is avoided for each plant taking part in the trial), with undeniable benefits for the environment, as well as economic savings.",
    "WASTEWATER ZLD DISCHARGE WITH ZERO LIQUID As regards waste generated by grid management activ- ities, in continuity with programs launched in previous years, the commitment to the recovery of special waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous, has continued.",

    "Role of raw materials in the energy transition and in Enel's strategy Over the past few years, there has been a heightened in- terest in raw materials as a result of growing demand in key energy sectors (renewables, storage systems, distribution networks, electric mobility) as well as pressing concerns over supply risks, price uncertainty, and environmental and social impacts.",
    "Against this backdrop, events such as the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions in recent years have added to the complexity of the issue, prompt- ing a shift in response from numerous organizations.",
    "For example, in early 2024 the European Union approved the Critical Raw Materials Act with the aim of fostering EU access to a competitive and sustainable supply of critical materials® by supporting the development of domestic supply chains and innovative research projects.",
    "This doc- ument lists 34 critical raw materials (including silicon, lith- ium, copper and aluminum), identified according to their economic importance and supply risk.",
    "Of the critical raw materials, 17 are listed as strategic given their use in tech- nologies of high strategic importance; these include rare earths, lithium and silicon, materials used in wind turbine motors (mainly in offshore wind turbines), batteries and photovoltaic panels.",
    "Back in 2020, Enel launched a working group that involves all internal business areas to develop and update the Group’s raw materials strategy, with a particular focus on critical raw materials.",
    "The Group's strategy involves: assessing raw material needs based on industrial and strategic plans and end-of- life material flows; risk and impact assessments on envi- ronmental, economic, geopolitical and social issues (with a particular focus on human rights); identifying priority areas of intervention; and lastly, developing measures to mitigate risks and impacts through specific business proj- ects and actions.",
    "The results of the analysis conducted by the working group in 2023 show that the equipment and related raw materials sourced by the Group (both currently and prospectively) are mainly tied to the development of re- newable technologies (photovoltaic, wind, batteries) and the distribution network, but also involve end-customer solutions and digital assets.",
    "With respect to the raw materials used by the Group, it is estimated that concrete and metals (steel, aluminum, copper) have the highest volumes (in tons).",
    "Concrete is the most widely used material, being used in particular for foundations of wind and solar power plants as well as grid assets such as substations and poles.",
    "Metals are present in all of the Group's assets: steel for wind towers, foun- dations, poles, transformers, public lighting, photovoltaic trackers; aluminum is used in cables and photovoltaic pan- els: and copper in various electronic components used in grid, wind, photovoltaic, and battery assets.",
    "Based on the most recent list of the Critical Raw Materials Act, the Group is estimated to require around 8% critical raw materials.",
    "If copper and aluminum (metals recently (1) Reported in the “Roadmap towards natural capital conservation” chapter of this Report.",

    "The materials identified as priorities for the Group are polysilicon, base metals (steel, copper, and aluminum), and specialized materials used in batteries (e.g., lithium and graphite).",
    "Identifying priority focus areas is key to determining the actions and circular economy projects needed to mitigate the associated risks and impacts (see the section on “Enel’s key circularity initiatives’).",
    "Some examples of these actions include developing spe- cialized expertise on raw materials, with an analysis of the recyclability of key assets (see the box on “Analysis of re- Analysis of recycling technologies for renewables In 2023, the raw materials working group conducted an analysis of current and forward-looking recycling technologies for key renewable technology equipment (wind turbine, photovoltaic module, lithium As INPUT MATERIALS » Main materials used - Steel ~- Copper - Aluminum - Composite materials WIND PLANTS Q 3 Stakeholder engagement and 4 Performance 2023 materiality analysis 5 Appendix cycling technologies for renewables”); targeted training on raw materials aimed at the units most involved in the topic; specialized studies (see the box on “Enel Founda- tion’); external benchmarks with other leading companies; analyses of market dynamics on raw materials; and focus groups with raw material producers.",
    "Enel also collaborates with associations and institutions active on the issue.",
    "For example, the Company is part of the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) — an initiative launched by the European Union in late 2020 with the aim of ensuring access to all raw materials needed to realize the vision for Europe's Green New Deal.",

    "Circular economy 179 In 2023, the Fondazione Centro Studi Enel (Enel Foundation) developed several initiatives to investigate possible material shortages and what has been called “green inflation”.",
    "This term was introduced to describe the rising prices of metals and minerals, such as copper, aluminum, and lithium, which are essential for solar and wind power, electric cars and other renewable technologies.",
    "To this end, as part of the collaboration agreement between Enel Foundation and ICMM (International Council on Mining and Metals), the study “Circularity in mining and renewable energy value chains.",
    "Technological, policy and financial aspects” was developed together with CCSI (Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment).",
    "The research focused on identifying the political, legal, regulatory and financial barriers in the mining and energy sector, as well as on the levers and strategies to explore potential circular business models and pathways for energy transition, to be adopted in line with the specific characteristics of the sectors and various value chains.",
    "The aim of the study was to highlight and disseminate the idea that, in order to eliminate technical and logistical barriers to circularity in solar and wind energy mining value chains, more political and financial support is needed, along with commitment from the sectors involved: from mining and metals companies through to utilities, manufacturers and research institutions.",
    "The report therefore prompts these sectors to actively develop strategies that increase the circularity of the critical materials needed for the energy transition.",
    "Circular economy metrics and targets In Enel’s journey towards circularity models, metrics have long been a key element in assessing the effectiveness of the solutions to be implemented and in defining a roadmap for improvement (for more information see the CirculAbility® model).",
    "Throughout the years, various in- dicators and metrics have been developed on the mea- surement objective, maintaining a joint approach based on both the quantitative analysis of all inout and output resource flows, and the dual assessment of environmen- tal and economic impacts.",
    "Specifically, two types of indicators are currently used at the Group level: e operational indicators, which measure in-depth the im- pacts of individual circular economy initiatives in both environmental (e.g., assessment of the tons of material recovered) and economic terms (eg., assessment of the EBITDA generated from the sale of materials for recovery): (3) https:/ccsi.columbia.edu/circular-economy-mining-energy.",

    "For example, with regard to overall performance apprais- al, the KPI “Improving circularity” was developed, which measures the reduction (compared to 2015) in the con- sumption of materials and fuels of the Group's plants against the energy generated.",
    "To extend this assessment not only to generation, but also to the activities of the entire Group, the Economic CirculAbility® indicator was developed, which considers the Group’s total EBITDA (in euros) and compares it with the amount of resources con- sumed (in tons) by the various business activities (both fu- els and raw materials) throughout the value chain.",
    "Claicl' materiality analysis 5 Appendix Enel’s key circularity initiatives The Group's action plan focuses on materials identified as priorities, but initiatives are also being pursued on oth- er materials such as plastics, composites, and concrete, which present significant challenges and highlight room for improvement in terms of circularity.",

    "Starting in 2024, the new high-efficiency HJT panel will optimize the amount of silicon in modules by using silicon slices that are 15% thinner.",
    "Innovations in metallization grids and Electrically Conductive Adhesives (ECAs) in panels are in the pipeline for the coming years, which will reduce silver use by 30% in 2025 and over 60% in the following years.",
    "Moreover, there will be a further increase of at least 20% in panel efficiency compared to today, by using a tandem structure which can produce more energy for the same amount of material used in the installed modules.",
    "Circular economy 181 With its Sustainable Procurement strategy, the Group aims to improve the sustainability of purchased products in terms of carbon footprint, circularity, and respect for human rights, through whole-life tracking of environmental and social impacts, and mechanisms to select the most virtuous suppliers on these issues.",

    "Sustainable supply chain 217 transition The energy transition begins in the classroom.",
    "This is why, once again this year, Enel continues to focus on the vocational training of young people with the aim of fostering their inclusion in the working environment of the energy industry.",
    "The “Energie per la Scuola’ (Energies for School) program, launched in 2021, starts from a very specific need for new skills adapted and updated with the latest technologies.",
    "For this reason, the training program coordinated by the Group puts forward for students in their final year of high school an innovative teaching method that combines classroom knowledge with vocational training, the ultimate objective being a direct job offer from Enel contractor companies upon completion of the program.",
    "The training course covers the profiles most in demand in the electrical sector.",
    "The aim is to create a bridge between education and the professional sphere, encouraging the students to acquire the skills needed to embrace the new professions of the energy transition, and facilitating their entry into the workplace with the Group's suppliers immediately after graduation, also through greater knowledge of the industrial realities in the industry.",
    "After the first two events dedicated to professions for the grid — with a headcount of about 550 students trained, the vast majority of whom have already been hired and the remainder of which are in the process of being hired in the businesses involved — the third event launched in 2023 extended its scope to renewables, involving additional Enel suppliers and nationwide educational institutions, with a calendar of presentations to entities throughout Italy.",

    "After signing a letter of commitment, mining participants in the program embark on a virtuous path by accepting on-site checks, carried out by independent third parties, to verify that the code’s principles have been applied, and agreeing an ongoing improvement plan to overcome any shortcomings.",
    "In addition to Bettercoal’s growing presence in various forums in the area of coal and supply chain sustainability, the initiative has become an example of collaboration among the various stake- holders, geared towards improving socially responsible practices, and from this a broader collaboration related to the responsible sourcing of other energy commodities is emerging.",

    "Conse- quently, the Group is committed to maintaining ongoing engagement with its customers, whether they are con- nected to the distribution grid or part of the energy and/ or gas market.",
    "Enel operates the electricity distribution grid globally through the Enel Grids Business Line, which serves more than 70 million customers.",
    "As a grid operator in European markets, where there is a separation between distribu- tion and sale of energy, Enel not only serves its own sales contract customers, but also customers who have supply A 230 Sustainability Report 2023 contracts with other operators.",
    "Moreover, the Group is committed to the path towards energy transition, bringing electricity generation closer to the end user, by promoting producers and prosumers, i.e., energy consumers who are also producers, who can both generate electricity for their own use and sell it to the grid.",
    "In 2023 alone, Enel Grids reached a record of almost 540 thousand new producer and prosumer connections, up 56% on the previous re- cord achieved in 2022 on a like-for-like basis.",
    "Every month, Enel adds around 45 thousand new connections to its distribution grids from producers and prosumers in Italy, Spain and Latin America.",
    "Italy is still Enel’s most dynamic market: throughout 2023, almost 1,000 new distributed generation connections were added per day, bringing the total number of producer and prosumer connections to around 1.5 million.",
    "In addition to grid management, Enel is also involved in the supply of electricity and gas, operating in both the regu- lated and free markets.",
    "At the end of 2023, the number of retail energy and gas customers was 61 million (67 million in 2022), of which more than 24 million were free mar- ket customers.",
    "The decrease in the number of customers, compared to 2022 (-8.5%), is largely due to the end of the regulated utility market in Italy; for the free market, the de- crease was mainly due to the sale of the business unit in Romania (around 3 million customers).",
    "Energy sales reached 300.9 TWh in 2023 (821.1 TWh in 2022) — down 6.3% compared to the previous year, which was however less than the drop in the number of custom- ers.",
    "Enel serves households (B2C), public institutions (B2G) and businesses (B2B) and has an integrated presence, of- fering an all-round service between commodity and ener- gy solutions, in five countries: Italy, Spain, Chile, Colombia and Brazil.",
    "In other Countries and Regions, such as North America, Asia Pacific, Poland, the United Kingdom and Ire- land, Enel provides products and services mainly aimed at business customers.",
    "Claicl' Customer centricity The energy sector is undergoing a major shift where con- sumers are becoming key contributors to both energy generation and consumption.",
    "Power plants are also more compact and dispersed than before.",
    "Grids will therefore have to adapt to handle the variable and decentralized na- ture of renewables, at multiple entry points, relying on the participation of prosumers in the evolution of the electric- ity system.",
    "To ensure a flexible grid and high service stan- dards, Enel is pushing for ever greater digitalization, both to foster the development of renewables and to support customers in the path toward electrification, leveraging the opportunities provided by emerging technologies.",
    "Enel also has the task of promoting access to a sustain- able, reliable and secure electricity service, ensuring that this service reaches the greatest number of customers, including those at risk and the most vulnerable.",
    "With this in mind, Enel supports electrification processes, both in mature contexts and in rural and remote areas where there are communities living without electricity, as well as connection standardization processes, so that no one is left behind.",
    "It also strives for inclusiveness of the ser- vices and products offered and to create shared value in the communities and areas involved.",
    "In this regard, around 583 thousand new beneficiaries were registered in rural and suburban areas by 2023.",
    "Moreover, Enel aims to meet the needs of retail custom- ers in a comprehensive, effective and structured manner, starting by listening and identifying their needs, and taking into account the target in scope as well as their respective geographical and social context.",

    "This way, it is possible to unlock local development potential by leveraging the specificities of local territories to offer more attractive solutions and savings opportunities and, in the case of companies, new business opportunities too.",
    "To stay apace with the evolving market, Enel encourages the active participation of customers in the energy tran- sition by raising awareness of their consumption and pro- viding greater control over it.",
    "With the support of technol- ogy, innovative solutions are made available to customers, which make the use of renewable electricity increasing- ly accessible and widespread in homes, businesses and cities, while accelerating the digitalization of services for greater energy efficiency, thereby helping to achieve de- carbonization targets.",
    "In order to increase its customer base and build custom- er loyalty, Enel has established a customer experience strategy based on the simplicity and accessibility of its contact channels (see the section on “Focus on vulnera- ble groups’), through clear communication, rapid and ex- haustive responses, and timely and effective resolution of requests (see the section on “Transparent relations’).",
    "By integrating the offers and merging the interaction chan- nels, greater efficiency in customer services is enabled in terms of attention to needs, administration and satisfac- tion.",

    "This type of customer is increas- ingly aware of the importance of making informed and re- sponsible energy choices.",
    "To meet this need, Enel leverages its customer care channels and provides content explain- ing price variations and — where possible in non-regulated markets — information on possible subsidies and incentives for customers in vulnerable conditions (see the paragraph “Focus on vulnerable groups”) or on more convenient offers and solutions for their consumption profile.",
    "Several initiatives were taken in Italy, such as the launch of the Simulatore Risparmio Energia (energy saving simulator) — an online tool to calculate the benefits of electrification in both economic and environmental terms.",
    "The increased Government bodies — Security and quality of life for citizens Customers in this segment are mainly public administra- tions and are spread across three main areas: Italy, Spain and Latin America (Chile, Colombia and Brazil).",
    "In Latin America, Enel works mainly with the bodies governing large metropolises, while in Italy the customer base is largely made up of small and medium-sized municipalities seeking new and efficient technological solutions.",
    "Spain is in the middle, with several projects in medium to large municipalities.",
    "The solutions dedicated to this segment support the adoption of programs serving citizens, improving their quality of life in terms of environmental and social im- pact and ensuring more efficient services, safety and air quality.",
    "To this end, Enel supplies diagnostic tools and intervention plans that make it possible to monitor the performance and improvements of the local area, as well as specific technical expertise for the planning and im- plementation of projects such as for smart cities (see the chapter on “Innovation’).",

    "In 2023, Enel achieved 268 MW of photovoltaic capacity at its industrial and commercial customers, and 9.6 GW in flexible capacity managed through demand response.",
    "De- mand response is a tool that allows direct intervention on energy generation and consumption levels to cope with supply reductions or peaks in market demand: industrial and commercial customers are paid for their availability, and the electricity grid benefits from greater stability and integration of renewables.",
    "In Italy, the introduction and regulation of Energy Com- munities will enable companies to play an increasingly proactive role in the energy transition (see the chapter on “Energy communities” for further information).",

    "The course aims to raise workers’ aware- ness of generic risks in the work environment, such as slips, collisions, driving, etc., and was taken by around 90% of the Enel Group population.",
    "e Safety Leadership course.",
    "Accident events that oc- curred in the distribution area highlighted the need to maintain a high level of awareness and attention from line managers on safety issues, to ensure the right level of involvement of all employees in compliance with safety procedures during fleld activities.",
    "With this in mind, the “Safety Leadership Path’ training proj- ect was rolled out, involving some 2,500 Enel Grids & Innovability Italia managers, for a total of more than 40,000 hours.",
    "This aim of the project was to share all aspects of safety, as a set of procedures, behaviors, skills and relationships, so that they become part of the daily work practices of managers, who are a key link in the dissemination of good practices in the field, leading by example.",
    "e “Onfield Observer” course.",
    "To ensure a high level of training for inspectors involved in field inspections to detect non-conformities that put workers at risk of inju- ry, the “Onfield Observer” training path was developed.",
    "This stems from the belief that detecting non-confor- mities and, in turn, establishing corrective and improve- ment actions, are a fundamental prevention tool, not only for gathering feedback from the field on practic- es, levels of knowledge and how rules are applied, but also to spread the culture of safety.",
    "The training was launched in the Enel Grids & Innovability Business Line and involved over 200 trainers in the various countries who will go on to train new inspectors.",
    "Lastly, some examples of projects developed with the in- volvement of the Business Lines to cover other areas of training, include: e “Gridverse” project - Grids & Innovability.",
    "A pilot proj- ect which uses the potential of the metaverse and “wearables” to simulate real interventions that can also be carried out in teams, on virtual plants, and to sim- ulate unforeseen events as well as the human impact of potential errors.",
    "The goal is to ensure effective, all- round experiential training.",
    "e “Major hazards video tutorials” project — Enel Green Power.",
    "A project that involved preparing and dissem- inating clear and simple videos which, together with work procedures, place the focus on how to perform activities safely.",
    "e “Sliding Doors” video — Enel X, Global Retail and Grids & Innovability.",
    "A project that involved creating and disseminating videos in 3D animation, with the aim of sharing the “lessons learned” from accidents and raising awareness of safety aspects by comparing the scenario of the accident event with what would have occurred if all operational instructions and safety pre- vention measures had been followed.",
    "Lastly, in 2023, a working group was launched also involving workers’ representatives on safety, which uses agile working modes to redesign their dedicated training course and inte- grate the technical aspects with the soft skills needed to bet- ter perform their role, to further engage professional figures, and to take on a greater and more effective role in the ongo- ing improvement process.",
    "In particular, work has been done on introducing experiential methods and new technologies (video, gaming, case studies, etc.) and Enel testimonials.",
    "The process of informing staff is systematically underway through various Company channels, such as intranet news, informational emails, Enel Radio, newsletters and maga- zines.",
    "Periodic surveys are carried out to gather feedback from colleagues on improving processes or safety initia- tives launched by the Company.",
    "Health and safety of people 5 Appendix establish initiatives together with Enel representatives to improve health and safety aspects in the workplace.",
    "In Italy and Spain, for example, the Bilateral Committee on Health and Safety usually meets once a month, and is an opportunity to gather early input on risk assessment and on identifying and implementing prevention initiatives in the Company.",
    "Special attention was also paid to contractor companies with the “Partnership for safety, health and the environ- ment” project which, in line with previous years, aims to raise contractors’ awareness of safety values by sharing best practices.",
    "Together with Global Procurement, a portal page was built in June 2022 dedicated to safety and en- vironmental issues, which is open to all contractor com- panies.",
    "This provides information/training materials, key policies and popular illustrative videos so that contractors can access all materials used by Enel for training and com- munication, with the aim of supporting them to improve their health and safety performance.",
    "In 2023, the portal was accessed around 2,300 times by contractor compa- nies operating across the Group.",
    "Infrastructure safety and technological innovation Enel sees technological innovation as a valid tool for im- proving a large number of health and safety processes.",
    "In line with previous years, some innovative safety and health projects continued to be developed and applied also in 2023.",
    "In fact, adopting innovative technologies is an im- portant operational lever for mitigating and managing safety risk, and is fundamental for further reducing work injuries.",
    "The criteria Enel uses when defining its project development priorities follow a “risk management” ap- proach, starting with an analysis of the context in which it is intended to intervene, based also on accident data and the types/frequencies of accidents that have occurred, with the core aim of eliminating the probability of an event occurring (é.g., making all structural changes to physical- ly prevent a worker from being injured — “intrinsic safety”) or reducing that probability through various degrees of implementation depending on actual feasibility (inverted pyramid: injury risk management hierarchy).",

    "One example is the “Remote Trimming” project, where Grids uses a robot which is remotely guided via a joystick to prune vegetation near power lines.",
    "The robot holds branches during pruning and safely lays them on the ground, allowing operators to stay out of the most dangerous areas and avoid the risk of electrical contact, falling from height, or falling objects.",
    "The system was tested and went live in 2023 in Brazil, where the activity is conducted very frequently and has caused several major injury events in the past.",
    "Innovative systems have also been developed for Also in Enel Grids, with regard to procedural controls, the “AlI@5RO ON EDGE” project was developed in 2023 to digitize, via an app, the 5 Golden Rules procedure, /.e., aset of basic rules for performing work with exposure to electrical risk in complete safety.",
    "Thanks to the app, the operator takes photos downstream of the execution of each rule.",
    "The photos are then analyzed to detect performing preliminary technical checks and operational activities without human intervention.",
    "One example is the new “SKYBOT” system, developed in 2023, which involves using a robot drone to perform inspections and work at height on the medium-voltage overhead grid.",
    "The drone is remotely controlled by an operator through a 3D viewer and allows inspections and complex work to be performed safely, away from live parts, thereby eliminating the risk of falling from height and electrocution.",
    "In 2024, there are plans to test prototypes in some areas of Grids Italia, followed by a scale-up phase also in other business areas in the two-year period 2025-2026, based on the feedback gathered in the testing phase.",

    "Health and safety of people 251 ment of people in the Company, not only at work but also in their daily life.",
    "For this reason, the Enel Group has ad- opted a structured health management system based on preventive and protection measures, and is committed to developing a corporate culture geared toward psycholog- ical-physical health, organizational well-being and a good work-life balance.",
    "An approach described in Policy 179 “Health and Wellbe- ing”, which lays out two main drivers of action: e health surveillance, which includes a series of preven- tive and periodic medical examinations and checks, based on specific health protocols established by the relevant doctor according to the assessment of risks to which each worker is exposed, in line with the regula- tions in force in each Country; e prevention and well-being initiatives, which include periodic screening campaigns and checks, workshops and awareness-raising and information initiatives, in Country-specific health and well-being action plans.",

    "The Policy also establishes a ban on smoking in all Enel workplaces and outside for a radius of 75 m from exits, windows and air sampling points, as required by the Well certification.",
    "In fact, in addition to its legislative compliance activities for its own workplaces, Enel has initiated a certification process for its key locations according to the interna- tional Well standard, which focuses on the well-being of occupants, and takes into account the use of renewable resources and environmental sustainability issues.",
    "There are currently 6 sites already certified (“platinum” level), 4 in the submission stage (including 2 that are part of the same building complex), and 7 more in the renovation/ documentation collection stage with the aim of gaining Well certification.",

    "The key initiatives on work-related stress risk assessment in 2023 were conducted in Italy and Spain.",
    "In Italy in partic- ular, the work-related stress survey was conducted based on a new methodology developed under the protocol in collaboration with INAIL, signed in 2022.",
    "This methodology involved analyzing new dimensions such as remote work, the use of new digital technologies, and a focus on newly hired staff.",
    "The activity consisted of two phases: Claicl' analysis of objective data (sentinel events), detection and analysis of content and context factors, through indicators/focus groups/interviews; *« in-depth survey by administering the questionnaire to all Italy Country employees (September-October 2023).",
    "Moreover, in 2023 Enel planned several initiatives to pro- tect the health and well-being of its workers, such as agreements with health facilities and nutritionist doctors (Wellbeing Program) and psychologists, as well as sports facilities both in Italy and abroad.",
    "Lastly, as part of the initiatives for the prevention of mus- Companies’ performance is constantly monitored both in the preventive phase and during contract execution through numerous processes and tools.",
    "The contractor companies’ qualification system provides for a specific assessment of H&S issues according to the H&& risk of the activities associated with the various Merchandise Groups (GMs): for low-risk GMs, the qualification process involves only the completion of an H&S questionnaire (self-assess- ment) by the company; for medium risk, a field assessment is also carried out by Enel (Contractor Assessment); and for high risk, there is an additional requirement to possess ISO 45001 certification.",
    "In view of an increasingly objective assessment of the lev- el of H&S risk associated with GMs, a new methodology was defined in 2023, adopting a “risk-based” approach, which involves assessing the H&& risk level of a GM as a product of the probability of an injury occurring, multi- plied by the severity of the potential injury, according to the type of risks associated with the GM's activities.",
    "This method was formalized in Policy 2414 “Methodology for assessing the H&S and ENV risk level of the Merchandise Groups”, published in December 2023.",
    "In 2023, a re-evalu- ation of the H&S risk level of GMs was initiated according to the new methodology.",
    "Specifically, 155 GMs were eval- uated (14 high risk, 14 medium risk, and 127 low risk), for 79% of which the current risk level was confirmed, while for 21% the risk level was re-evaluated (4 GMs went from low to high risk, 26 GMs from low to medium risk, and 2 GMs from high to low risk).",
    "The analysis so far has mainly involved low-risk GMs for services or supplies with instal- lation, and will be extended in 2024 to the remaining GMs for medium and high H&s risk.",
    "During the tender phase, a specific document is prepared (HSE Terms), and attached to all contracts that must be signed by contractors when the work is awarded.",

    "The aim of the course is to prevent injuries and health disorders by tackling bad habits in day-to-day practices, which are often done auto- matically, underestimating the risks and potential conse- quences.",

    "This tool clarifies Enel’s requirements and conveys their impor- tance to contractors; it also defines a list of safety and en- vironmental violations that can involve specific penalties, up to the termination of the contract and/or suspension of qualification on the Enel contractor companies’ portal.",
    "With a view to using indicators that can predictively mea- sure the effectiveness of contractors’ safety processes and guide prevention strategies based on a “data-driven” ap- proach, the Enel Group has adopted a set of KPIs, the most important of which is the Fatality Risk Index (FRI).",
    "This pre- dictive parameter is based on a modular logic: through the weighted combination of the main safety indicators (such as injuries, hours worked, inspections and non-compliance), it establishes the level of accident risk of the specific contrac- tor operating in a specific Country or at Group level.",
    "The FRI therefore aims to intercept possible critical situations that could cause an injury.",
    "All contractors’ safety KPls, including the FRI, are available to all units involved (e.g., O&M, E&C, HSEQO, Procurement) so that each one, for its own remit, can assess the safety performance of the contractor company and, in turn, act to mitigate or prevent all risks by enacting consequence management actions.",
    "There are two types of consequence management, which are applied to high- and medium-risk GMs for H&S: pro- active and reactive.",
    "Proactive consequence management introduces a pre- ventive and selective approach of monitoring contractors, with the aim of anticipating and correcting possible future critical issues.",
    "It involves ongoing monitoring of contrac- tors’ H&S performance to guide and apply a customized set of corrective and/or improvement measures.",
    "The aim of reactive consequence management, on the other hand, is to evaluate the measures to be taken against the contractor involved in critical health and safe- ty events (HiPo accidents-LCA-Fatalities).",
    "In this regard, a cross-functional committee (Evaluation Group) is formed, consisting of contact persons from the HSEQO and Pro- curement Functions and the Business Line concerned to Health and safety of people 5 Appendix sponsibility of the contractor company, the level of safety culture within the contractor company’s organization, as well as the performance of safety KPIs over time, are an- alyzed to assess corrective/improvement actions for the contractor company.",
    "Both consequence management processes end with phased actions depending on the severity of the situa- tion.",
    "These range from increased inspections by Enel or the contractor company itself, safety support from Enel, additional Contract Assessments, specific action plans for the contractor company which Enel monitors and to which more significant actions may apply, periodic meet- ings with the contractors’ top management to discuss the progress of safety KPIs, joint Enel-Contractor safety walks, as well as a reduction in the scope or volume of activities, or suspension of the contractor.",

    "This, while also paying constant attention to social and envi- ronmental factors, makes it possible for Enel to adopt a new fair development model that does not leave anyone behind, and create shared value over the long term for alll stakeholders.",
    "Enel adopts the best safety and efficiency standards for all installations and plants in the local area, not only to comply with legal requirements and good engineering standards, but also to avert the risk of injury to third parties.",
    "Indeed, the Enel Group pays close attention to the prevention of injuries occurring to the population, for example, due to accidental contact with power grids, at construction sites close to lines or sports activities, such as fishing, recre- ational activities, etc.",
    "For this reason, the Group has ad- opted a process for monitoring third-party accident events that occur in the various countries where it op- erates, classifying them by type, frequency, and business areas impacted, on a par with the injuries of its own em- ployees and contractors.",
    "Moreover, awareness campaigns are conducted periodically, targeted at both the general public and specific categories, such as construction com- panies and sports associations.",
    "In many countries, such as 254 Sustainability Report 2023 Brazil and Italy, school meetings are organized, as well as training/awareness-raising at plants, meetings with local communities and trade associations (artisans, construc- tion companies, electricians, fishing associations, etc), distribution of leaflets, awareness-raising in DIY stores, etc.",
    "The goal of these initiatives is to prevent as much as possible third-party injury events tied to Enel’s installations within communities.",
    "For example, injuries due to kites ac- cidentally coming into contact with live lines (which in the past has significantly affected Brazilian children) have de- creased by around 70% in the last 4 years thanks to these initiatives (40% decrease in 2023 compared to 2022).",
    "Lastly, again with the aim of ensuring the health and safety of the community and reducing the impact on the exter- nal environment due to typical Company activities, Enel carries out periodic monitoring campaigns, including, for example, measuring the level of electromagnetic fields of the distribution plants, and detecting the level of noise, vi- brations and dust generated by the electrical machinery of the power plants and distribution/transformer substa- tions.",

    "REFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK STRATEGIC The strong internationalization of the Group — located in various regions, including South America, North America and Africa — makes Enel obligated to consider and assess the so-called “Country risk”, which consists of risks of a macroeconomic and financial, institutional and social nature and those associated with the energy sector, which could cause a significant effect on income fiows and the value of company assets if they occur.",
    "The Group also operates in regulated markets and changes in the operating rules of the various systems, as well as the asso- ciated requirements and obligations, influence the Group's trend of operations and results.",
    "The analysis of the competitive landscape and the consequent risks associated with market trends are significant elements of the analysis of the context in which the Group operates and defines its business ambitions.",
    "MITIGATION ACTIONS AND ASSOCIATED STRATEGIC GOALS Enel has adopted a quantitative Open Country Risk assessment model that is able to monitor the risk of the Countries within its own scope.",
    "The Open Country Risk model aims to go beyond the more conventional definition of Country risk focused on the ability of a government to repay its issued debt, to offer a broader view of the risk factors that can impact a country.",
    "Specifically, the model is divided into four risk components: economic, institutional and political, social and energy factors.",
    "Legislative and regulatory developments are constantly monitored, such as the periodic review of the regulations in the distribution sector and the processes of liberalization of the electricity markets, with particular attention to the acceleration expected in Italy, and to the expectations of evolution in Latin America.",
    "In relation to risks that may arise from these changes, relations were intensified with local government and regulatory bodies, adopting an approach based on transparency, col- laboration and proactiveness in addressing and removing sources of instability of the legislative and regulatory framework.",
    "The risks associated with market trends are also mitigated by the periodic monitoring of competitors’ comparative industrial and financial performance.",
    "Assessment is carried out through a framework aimed at (i) identifying the most relevant competitors and peers, (ii) analyzing their results, the main business drivers, strategic and industrial objectives, and (ili) understanding their current and prospec- tive positioning.",

    "In this context, the ACTIONS AND © Group has brought forward its public commitment by 10 years, from 2050 to 2040, to complete the decarbonization process ASSOCIATED of its entire value chain, including its own direct and indirect emissions (so-called “Net Zero’).",
    "STRATEGIC GOALS Along its path to complete decarbonization, Enel has created a roadmap that has medium-term objectives by 2030 with respect to the levels of the year of reference 2017 certified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in line with the 1.5 °C pathway.",
    "In particular, the Company is committing to reducing: (i) 80% of direct greenhouse gas emissions connected to pow- er generation per kWh, in line with the 1.5 °C pathway, as already certified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBT), (ii) 78% of the emissions connected to electricity sales per kWh, (iii) 55% of the absolute emissions connected to the retail sale of gas and (iv) 55% of the other absolute direct and indirect emissions.",
    "The Group’s strategic actions make it possible to mitigate the potential risks and exploit the opportunities associated with transition variables.",
    "In this context, capital employment is centered on decarbonization through the development of assets for generation from renewable sources, on enabling infra- structure linked to the development of networks, and on the implementation of platform models, fully exploiting technologi- cal and digital evolution which will favor consumption electrification and the development of new services for end customers.",
    "STRATEGIC Furthermore, Enel participates in the entire electricity value chain and has a diversified activities portfolio, both in terms of generation technologies and the Countries and Regions in which it operates, mitigating climate change risks and their implications in terms of economic and financial impacts.",
    "The management of weather and climate phenomena adopts the best strategies for prevention, protection and increasing resilience.",
    "For example, the Group uses weather forecasts, procedures for the management of adverse events and monitor- ing and analysis activities that provide for the definition of actions to protect and increase resilience, both for existing assets and for those under construction.",
    "Also, best practices are implemented in relation to physical events to ensure prompt re- covery of operating conditions following adverse events.",

    "REFERENCE SCENARIO AND DESCRIPTION OF RISK The speed of technological development, which brings an endless stream of new challenges, the frequency and intensity of the ever increasing number of cyber attacks, as well as the tendency to strike critical infrastructure and strategic industrial sectors, highlight a risk that can cause normal business operations to grind to a halt in extreme cases.",
    "Cyber attacks have changed dramatically in recent years: the number has grown exponentially, as has their level of complexity and impact.",
    "Within the scope of the Group, the management of the cyber risk results, among other aspects, from the numerous contexts in which it operates (data, industry, and people), in addition to the intrinsic complexity and interconnection of digital resources which, over the years, have been increasingly integrated into the Group’s routine operating processes.",
    "In this context, it is clear that cyber risk must be managed without hesitation and in an integrated manner.",
    "In a nutshell, technological transfor- mation would be unthinkable without paying careful attention to cyber security issues.",
    "MITIGATION ACTIONS AND ASSOCIATED STRATEGIC GOALS To oversee cyber risk, the Group has defined the Cyber Security operating model and a related process framework.",
    "Specif- ically, the operating model defines roles and responsibilities for the implementation of the framework’s processes, providing for an ad hoc unit, whose responsibility is entrusted to the CISO (Head of Cyber Security) and integrated into a matrix also aimed at the Group's business areas.",
    "In addition, the Group has designed and adopted a holistic framework of processes aimed at management of cyber security issues, applicable across the board to the Information Technology (IT), Operational Technology (OT) and Internet of Things (loT) sectors.",
    "The framework defines a governance model based on the commitment of Top Management, the global strategic approach, the involvement of all business areas, as well as the units engaged in the design and implementation of the IT, OT and lol systems to act as a solid basis for the complete fusion of technologies, processes, and people.",
    "The framework is based on two essential principles, i.e, the “risk-based approach’ and “cyber security by design”.",
    "The former establishes that risk assessment is the prerequisite for strategic decisions and for the secure develop- ment and maintenance of all assets of the business organization: the latter ensures the adoption of cyber security principles from the outset and throughout the entire life cycle of solutions, services, and infrastructures in all areas, ie.",
    "IT, OT, and loT.",
    "In applying this framework, the cyber risk management method has been established.",
    "It is also applicable to all IT, OT and loT environments and includes the phases required to carry out a risk analysis and define the related mitigation plan, in line with the stated cyber security goals.",
    "To balance the advantages obtained by the operation and use of IT/OT/loT systems with the risk that can potentially derive from them, well-informed, risk-based decisions are of fundamental importance.",
    "Enel has also set up a Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) to respond to and proactively manage possible cyber se- curity incidents.",
    "To measure the possible impacts of cyber risk in economic and financial terms, Enel has developed the “Cyber Value-at-Risk” (\"Enel Group Cyber V@R®”) methodology, which is currently evolving, to calculate Value-at-Risk in different attack scenarios.",

    "The main health and safety risks to which Enel’s people and contractors are exposed are related to the operating assets carried out at the Group's sites and assets.",
    "These risks can vary, or even change, depending on economic and social trends, as well as the introduction of digitalization into processes and operational activities.",
    "Another type of risks related to health and safety are those due to non-compliance with the laws and regulations in force, which have an impact on people's health and safety, and which can lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, and therefore to economic, financial, and reputational impacts on the Enel Group.",
    "MITIGATION Each of the Group’s Business Lines has its own Health and Safety Management System in compliance with the international ACTIONS AND _ standard UNI ISO 45001, which also takes into account the rigor in the selection and management of contractors and sup- ASSOCIATED pliers.",
    "The Management System is based on the identification of hazards, the qualitative and quantitative assessment of the STRATEGIC risks, including economic-financial and reputational risks, the planning and implementation of the preventive and protective GOALS measures, the check of the effectiveness of these measures and any corrective actions.",
    "These systems make it possible to ensure regulatory compliance, to verify the effectiveness of processes and related remedial actions and, finally, to ensure the diffusion and dissemination of a “risk-based” approach, as well as a robust organizational and individual culture on more general health and safety issues.",
    "The key document for these systems is the Group’s Health and Safety Policy, shared with the Board of Directors and signed by the Chief Executive Officer, which sets out the guiding principles, strategic objectives, ap- proach and guidelines, and priorities for action to continuously improve performance in the field of health and safety at work.",
    "From an operational point of view, health and safety risks are assessed specifically at each site or Company asset on the basis of the activities carried out by workers and external environmental conditions.",
    "This assessment makes it possible to identify prevention and protection measures for safety in the workplace and to plan their implementation, improvement and control, in order to verify their effectiveness and efficiency.",
    "At Group level, the analysis of the events of the last three years shows that, in relation to probability of occurrence, mechanical risks (falls, knocks, crushing and cuts) are the most common, while in terms of potential associated impact, electrical risks are those with the most severe consequences, /.e., fatalities, life change, and HiPo (High Potential, which differ from fatalities, and life-changing only relating to the consequences for the worker but not in terms of dynamics).",

    "ie) Constant monitoring of behavior and compliance with procedures and methods of working in the field aimed at the prop- er management of risks to health and safety at work by both internal staff and contractors is ensured at Enel by a process of inspections, managed both by internal staff and by certified companies, which is aimed at identifying situations at risk (non-compliance) and the relevant plans containing remedial actions, including training courses, coaching, and dissemina- tion of safety culture.",
    "With regard to contractors, Enel’s approach is to consider them as partners with whom to share the key principles of health and safety for its workers, who are therefore considered on an equal footing with internal employees in the application of these principles and in the attention to occupational health and safety issues.",
    "Therefore, safety is integrated into the procure- ment processes and the performance of the companies is monitored both in the preventive phase, through the qualification system, and in the execution phase of the contract, through numerous control processes and tools such as the Contractor Assessment (analyses performed on contractors during the qualification phase or in cases where critical issues or low scores emerge in the evaluation of indicators) or the Evaluation Groups (periodic cross-functional meetings, distributed across all Global Business Lines and Countries and Regions, to assess the security performance of suppliers and decide on conse- quence management actions).",
    "In addition to procedural and operational aspects, another important driver in the proper management of health and safety risks is related to training, awareness and information activities for people.",
    "In order to promote the growth of technical skills and a culture of safety, supporting change processes, and responding in a timely manner to the needs that emerge from the business, the Enel Group has adopted a structured training management process, which aims to transform knowledge into skills and therefore into behavior.",
    "In addition, Enel systematically promotes the process of informing and raising awareness among staff through various com- pany channels such as intranet news, information emails, newsletters, and magazines, periodically carrying out surveys to collect feedback from colleagues on the improvement of processes or communication initiatives aimed at raising awareness among all workers on compliance with safety procedures and carving out moments of collective reflection on the dynamics and causes that have resulted in severe injuries or fatalities.",
    "Finally, Enel is also constantly engaged in external discussions with top international players operating in the energy sector and beyond, through participation in intercompany roundtables set up, with a view to continuous improvement, to share best practices in the field of health and safety, in terms of both operational processes and innovative initiatives.",

    "The identification of the relevant types of offences in the Enel Global Compliance Program — which is associated with the provision of behavioral standards and areas to be preventively monitored - is based on illicit conduct generally considered as such in most parts of the coun- tries, such as, for example, offences of corruption, crimes against the public administration, fraudulent accounting, money laundering, offences committed in violation of the regulations on safety at work, environmental offences, etc.",

    "Enel's Anti-Bribery Management System (ABMS) is based on the Group's commitment to fighting corruption by ap- plying the criteria of transparency and conduct as set out in the Zero Tolerance of Corruption Plan (ZTC Plan) and confirmed in the Anti-Bribery Policy adopted in compli- ance with international standard ISO 37001:2016 (on an- ti-bribery management systems).",
    "Together with the ZTC Plan, the pillars underpinning the ABMS are: e the Code of Ethics; e Models to prevent the main criminal risks (for example, bribery in relations with government bodies and among private individuals, environmental offences, corporate offences and, for Italian companies, manslaughter, seri- ous personal injury or grievous bodily harm committed in violation of the rules on the protection of occupa- tional health and safety), as described by the applicable regulations on corporate responsibility in the various countries where the Group operates (eg., Organiza- tional Model 231 for Italian companies, the “Risk Pre- vention Model/Integrity Program’ for Group companies in Spain and Latin America): e the Enel Global Compliance Program (“EGCP”), which applies to the Group's non-ltalian companies and sup- plements any compliance programs they adopt in com- pliance with local regulations.",
    "The mentioned governance measures (in relation to which further information can be found in the specific section of the website), together with the current body of proce- dures, outline an effective prevention system, which is an integral part of the Group's Internal Control System.",
    "In 2017 Enel SpA was among the first companies in the world to obtain certification of the conformity of its An- ti-Bribery Management system to international standard ISO 37001:2016 (“Anti-Bribery Management System’).",
    "This certification was issued following an independent verification process, carried out by a primary accredited certification body, which was carried out in two separate phases, aimed primarily at certifying the adequacy of the design of the Enel Anti-Bribery Management System (in terms of governance, roles, and responsibilities, control procedures, etc.), and secondarily at assessing the level of application and effectiveness.",
    "After Enel SpA obtained certification ISO 37001 for its an- ti-bribery management system, it gradually extended the 3/7001 certification plan to the Group's main Italian and for- eign subsidiaries, guaranteeing maintenance of the certi- fications already obtained.",
    "In 2023 the Audit Function plan included an analysis of the suitability of the Internal Control System for the An- ti-Bribery Management System of all Group Business Lines and Holding Company Staff Functions; the specific audit plans included checks to assess the risk and suitability of the design and operation of the controls, complementing the spot checks required by the Compliance Programs adopted by Group companies.",

    "In fact, Enel recognizes that personal data, as an expression of an individual's personality and identity, must be treated with due care and guarantees, whether they concern customers, employees or suppliers, as also stated in the Group’s Human Rights Policy and Code of Ethics.",
    "To respond to this challenge in line with the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679 — “GDPR’), in 2017 Enel set up a specific unit within the Legal Function (Data Protection Office) and appointed the data supervisors (\"Data Protection Officer” - DPO).",
    "The DPOs are appointed based on their professional skills and knowledge, and their ability to carry out the assigned tasks in accordance with the principle of independence.",
    "The Data Protection Office is structured as follows: e Data Protection Governance: a unit that monitors the evolution of data protection legislation and defines the Group's compliance.",

    "In 2020 country units were set up in Latin America (Ar- gentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru), alongside the European area units already in place (Italy, Portugal, Ro- mania, Spain).",
    "The Enel Group has developed a global compliance pro- gram on personal data protection, founded on the princi- ples of the main privacy regulations, including the GDPR, the Brazilian law Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados Pessoais (“LGPD\"), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA\"), as well as the local legislation of the countries in which the Group operates.",
    "This compliance program is translated into a global policy on personal data protection, which defines the privacy principles applicable to all Group companies.",
    "In particular, the Data Protection Office implements pro- 282 Sustainability Report 2023 cesses and activities in compliance with the indications of legislation concerning personal data protection and is committed to: drawing up data protection agreements and clauses; planning data governance and corporate policies; providing consulting in line with the principles of privacy by design and by default; ensuring adequate risk manage- ment and monitoring the consistency of data protection policies within the organization; as well as performing pe- riodic and regular training and awareness campaigns for personnel on the main data protection issues.",
    "Furthermore, the Audit Function includes specific activi- ties in their work programs targeted toward evaluating the Internal Control System on Data Protection Risk Man- agement and on compliance with GDPR: analysis activities are planned in various geographical areas, also those not subject to GDPR, that aim to evaluate the safety measures in systems that contain personal data, commercially-sen- sitive data and employees data managed in HR processes.",
    "In order to guarantee full and effective protection of per- sonal data, the Group has adopted a digital platform (Data Protection Platform), which is able to ensure digital com- pliance, through the use of the following tools, based on the size and complexity of Enel: e Processing register, which integrates the registers of the data controller and the data processor on a single platform, guaranteeing the dynamic mapping of the processing activities and their life cycle, as well as the fulfilment of the obligations required by the regulation.",
    "For the Enel Group, this tool also represents an essen- tial resource for designing and monitoring intra-group dynamics; e Privacy by Design, which makes it possible to create every new project, from the beginning, in line with the principles regarding privacy; e DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment), which makes it possible not only to perform an evaluation of the effective risks for the freedom and rights of the data subjects and to monitor the current risk of each processing operation that is changed in light of the im- plementation of a remedy plan; e DTIA (Data Transfer Impact Assessment), which makes it possible to evaluate the transfer risk that accounts for the methods by means of which the data is trans- ferred, as well as the regulatory aspects of the country where this data is transferred; e Data Breach Management, which permits the struc- tured and timely management of all possible incidents that involve multiple companies and countries, and the possibility to study these events in order to implement common prevention solutions; Claicl' s Analytic, that, with the definition of precise KPI, makes it possible to continuously analyze, compare and monitor the data and processes processed by the companies.",
    "With specific reference to relationships with its suppliers, the Enel Group Code of Ethics and Human Rights Policy expressly require suppliers to have a clear commitment to respect the main obligations required by the appli- cable privacy regulation.",
    "Furthermore, a specific clause in the Group's General Contract Conditions extends the principles of the Enel privacy policies to all suppliers, re- quiring them to be committed to handing personal data in compliance with the obligations imposed by industry With specific reference to Italy, on March 8, 2021, the data protection authority started a procedure, based on some reports from consumers, for the adoption of corrective measures and sanctions against the Servizio Elettrico Nazionale (SEN) for presumed violations of pri- vacy regulations, in particular due to the performance of undesired phone calls and the wrongful provision of personal data (POD, supply address, tax code, etc.) to unauthorized parties for the promotional purposes of third parties.",

    "On April 26, 2021 a hearing was held with the data protection authority and a decision is pending.",
    "Furthermore, on January 18, 2022, the data protection authority issued an order against Enel Energia, imposing a fine for approximately 26 million euros on the compa- ny for asserted violations of the privacy regulations.",
    "In particular, the data protection authority criticized what it saw as the inadequacy of Enel Energia’s surveillance and control activities for the internal data processing pro- cesses, within the scope of telemarketing activities, as well as the failed adoption of a comprehensive and ef- fective action to contrast the undesired phone calls.",
    "The penalty, which also imposed a series of prescriptive mea- sures, was disputed by Enel Energia on February 9, 2022 before the Civil Court of Rome which, with an order dated March 20, 2022, ordered the immediate suspension of its effects.",
    "In a ruling published on February 13, 2023, Enel Energia’s appeal was upheld in its entirety and, accord- ingly, the sanction measure was cancelled.",
    "On January 18, 2024, the grounds for the decision were published, on the basis of which the data protection authority may consider a possible appeal of the ruling before the Court of Cassation.",

    "Therefore, Endesa Energia filed an administrative appeal against the measure issued by the data protection authority, before the National Su- preme Court requesting the precautionary suspension of the sanction.",
    "The final decision of the Court is currently awaited.",

    "With regard to prior proceedings related to marketing communications made in 2019, 2020 and 2021, for which Endesa has al- ready presented its defense, in 2023 the data protection authority issued 3 rulings, for one of which it ordered the dismissal of the proceedings, while for the others it imposed sanctions with an overall value of 12,500 euros.",
    "Furthermore, it should be noted that one of the final de- cisions that led to the imposition of a fine (in the amount of 5,000 euros) was challenged by Endesa.",
    "In fact, the company was sanctioned for having made a direct mar- keting call without the consent of the data subject, but the number from which the call was made was not a number belonging to Endesa or one of its data control- lers.",
    "In addition, with reference to the second decision, a fine of 7500 euros was imposed.",
    "In particular, Endesa had been accused of committing two administrative in- fringements, but the Comissao Nacional de Protecao de Dados (\"“CNPD\") considered this to be a single adminis- trative infringement, carried out on a continuous basis, and therefore decided to impose a single penalty.",
    "Regarding data breaches, during 2023, seven violations of personal data were recorded within the scope of the Enel Group.",
    "In particular, in Italy, the company Enel Energia SpA notifed the data protection authority of a breach, which occurred in March 2023, concerning personal data on the company’s Customer Relationship Management (\"CRM\").",
    "Specifical- ly, several SEPs (Spazio Enel Partner, ie, shops open to the public managed by external partners) reported to Enel Ener- gia that they had been contacted on the landline number of their shop by people pretending to be Enel Energia operators and asking them to install anew app for security reasons, and to provide their Enel Energia CRM access credentials for this purpose.",
    "The latter immediately alerted all partners in its sales network, advising them to be very careful if they received similar communications and requests.",
    "However, some of the partners’ operators had already followed up the fraudulent message and, in eight cases, credentials had been provided.",
    "These credentials were found to have been used by unknown persons to view the data of some 679 individuals, among whom customers, potential customers and customer refer- rals.",
    "However, further analysis by Enel Energia showed that no abnormal use of the personal data displayed had occurred.",
    "284 Sustainability Report 2023 In Romania, during July 2022, and following an investiga- tion, the local data protection authority issued a penalty of 49,337 lei (10,000 euros) against Enel Energie Munte- nia SA for violation of Article 32 of GDPR.",
    "The company has challenged this penalty and is still waiting for the final decision of the data protection authority.",
    "In Colombia, in September 2023, the Colombian data protection authority notified Resolution No.",
    "48205, through which it pronounced two administrative orders following four security incidents (occurring in 2021-2022) that could have compromised the personal information contained within Market/Enel X’s databases.",
    "On the ba- sis of the reported security incidents and the measures taken to manage them, the local data protection author- ity deemed it necessary to analyze not only the controls that the company had put in place, but also the security measures, which were necessary to determine the ade- quacy and effectiveness of the personal data protection standards and to check whether it was necessary to im- plement additional security measures to those already in place.",
    "On December 4, 2023, Enel Colombia provided feedback on all the points raised.",
    "To date, however, the data pro- tection authority has not ruled on them.",
    "In Romania, during 2023 two data breaches were record- ed.",
    "In particular, a limited amount of personal data was displayed in the private section of the e-Distributie web- site.",
    "Through a link with a hidden object, some users of the website were able to access a limited set of data of other users.",
    "As far as is known, apart from the person who reported the vulnerability, no one else took advantage of it.",
    "Based on the investigations carried out by the Compa- ny, the data illegally accessed belonged to customers of e-Distributie Muntenia and e-Distributie Dobrogea.",
    "Since the person who reported the vulnerability also reported it to the DPA, notification of the incident was deemed ap- propriate, even though said incident was not considered serious and no impact on the individuals concerned was detected.",
    "The vulnerability was fixed in less than 24 hours from the moment the owners became aware of it.",
    "In Spain, during 2023, Edistribuciédn Redes Digitales SL (“Edistribuci6n’) notified the Spanish data protection au- thority (AEPD) of two personal data breaches suffered by its customers.",
    "The first, reported on January 23, 2023, concerns an acci- dental exposure of some Edistribuciédn customer data on “oe the public repository “Github” by an engineer of a suppli- er of the company who used this repository temporarily in order to make a copy of the source code of the Exabeat application.",
    "The measures taken include resetting the cre- dentials identified within the FTP server within the Exabeat application and analyzing the access logs to the FTP server.",
    "The above analysis showed that there was no evidence of access to any personal data processed by the FTP server.",
    "On January 23, 2024, the AEPD dismissed the proceedings initiated as a result of the “Github” data breach, finding that Edistribuci6n had acted diligently once it became aware of the security breach, demonstrating that the measures taken after the incident were adequate.",
    "As for the second breach, it originated neither from a leak nor from an incident or unauthorized access to Edistribu- cidn’s systems.",
    "In particular, an Internet forum was intercepted to pub- lish the sale of data of “Endesa customers”, together with an Excel file published on Google Docs that contained, among various fields, one relating to the supply of the distribution company in which “Endesa Distribucién Eléc- trica SL” appeared.",
    "Once these data and those contained in Edistribucién’s systems were analyzed, it emerged that the published data did not come from Edistribucidn itself.",
    "However, although Edistribuci6n did not suffer any data breaches, it considered it appropriate to inform the AEPD, given the media impact of the incident.",
    "3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis & BasaBacomenspan even SONS: * SITS Marhie stitse In Portugal, in May 2023, the company Aon (one of Ende- sas data controllers that processes the personal data of its employees) was made aware of a zero-day vulnerabil- ity concerning a third-party provider's application called “MOVEIt Transfer”, which Aon was using for file sharing.",
    "Upon learning of this vulnerability, Aon immediately launched an investigation, which established that an un- authorized third party had accessed the “MOVEIit Transfer” application/server within Aon, and that the data contained in that application had been downloaded and exfiltrated.",
    "Among the breached data were those of Endesa employ- ees with whom Aon was dealing.",
    "Given the type of person- al data breached (first name, last name, e-mail, address, tax code, date of birth, international bank account number — N.B.",
    "not all IBANs of the data subjects were disclosed), Endesa notified the data breach to the Portuguese data protection authority and the various stakeholders.",
    "In Colombia, the local data protection authority was noti- fled of a personal data breach, consisting of a ransomware attack (of the “RansomHouse’ type) affecting the websites and activities of an employee healthcare provider.",

    "Finally, when analyzing the size of intercompany trans- actions, it can be seen that these account for a minimal percentage (generally around 6%) of the Group's total aggregate revenues”, due to the fact that the energy business is conducted almost entirely within the bound- aries of the individual Country, from the power gener- ation process to market sales.",

    "(3) The average value shown for 2023 is lower than the average value for previous years due to the results for the 2021 tax year, which, with the same number of intercompany transactions, saw an exponential increase in commodities and associated hedging transactions, with impacts on revenues, which led to an increase in this percentage to 10% in the reporting year, accordingly increasing the average value.",

    "Considering that the aforementioned Global Minimum Tax regulation (the ETR Minimum Tax indicator and the tests related to the substance and economic relevance of the business) has become a reference for defining a “Low-tax jurisdiction”, the Enel Group has decided to use this defl- nition and, in keeping with its tax transparency strategy, represents that from the estimates made on the basis of the best interpretation of the documents published by the OECD, on the data as of December 31, 2023, almost alll of the Group countries appear to have adequate levels of taxation and substantial level of presence of its business.",
    "On a more general level, while adopting the ETR as de- fined by the rules on the minimum tax as a reference for identifying countries potentially having preferential taxa- tion, Enel believes that the most representative indicator for evaluating the tax contribution in the territories where it has a presence is the Total Tax Contribution as defined in this section relating to tax transparency.",

    "In turn, an action plan was drawn up geared toward containing and reducing emissions through practices of optimizing cloud sizing, increasing the renewable power supply of digital infrastructure, and green coding — a software development mode that aims to limit the energy consumption required to execute algorithms.",
    "This led to a 36% reduction in CO, emissions from digital sources as of 2023 compared to 2018, a 206% increase in the processing capacity of the Group's systems, and a 90% increase in data storage capacity.",

    "Digitalization 355 sumes a key role in ensuring the normal operation of businesses, including in view of the significant increase in cyber attacks as well as their level of sophistication and impact.",
    "Industry studies confirm that, in line with the trend of pre- vious years, the perception of cyber risk is growing steadi- ly, despite the fact that previous years have been strong- ly characterized by conflicts and geopolitical tensions.",
    "National security agencies have therefore warned public and private institutions of potential cyber threats against critical infrastructure, often generated by activists from national and international organizations.",
    "Over the last few years, many of the world’s major attacks have been carried out by leveraging the supply chain and through compro- mised third parties, which allowed attackers to target the primary target's customers, partners and suppliers.",
    "This caused a sharp rise in the number of victims and attacks went increasingly undetected (the so-called “scale effect’).",
    "Itis also seen how the vulnerabilities detected in common- ly used software products are continuously increasing and how they are taken advantage of with greater speed by IT criminals.",
    "In particular, the “zero-day” type vulnerabilities represent a large risk because they are exploited by cyber criminals to carry out attacks before software developers become aware of them and before they can release a cor- rective update (patch).",
    "With reference to the energy sector, the majority of cyber attacks include ransomware, an increasingly used method that causes the exfltration (unauthorized copy, transfer or recovery) of the victim's data and its encryption, which gives the people responsible for the attack an addition- al lever for receiving payment of ransom.",
    "Along with this type, 2023 saw an increase in social engineering attacks, the first step performed by cyber criminals before launch- ing the full-fledged attack.",
    "This type leverages the victim's In line with the needs of the energy industry, the Group has adopted a systemic vision of cyber security issues, as well as a global strategy of analysis, prevention and management of cyber security events.",
    "Since September 2016, a Cyber Security unit was es- tablished in the Global Information and Communication Technology (GICT) Function reporting directly to the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and whose manager has the role of Group Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).",
    "The unit is committed to ensuring the governance, direction 356 Sustainability Report 2023 difficulties in recognizing the attack, exploiting emotions such as fear and a sense of urgency to push them into performing a certain action (eg., send money, divulge sensitive information, or share login credentials).",
    "Further- more, market analysis and studies affirm that there is a high probability of an increase in cyber threats over the following few years due to an increasingly intensive use of generative Artificial Intelligence on the part of cyber crim- inals to refine attack techniques by successfully exploiting weaknesses linked to the human factor.",
    "The global increase in cyber threats therefore constitutes an important rick factor for the Group, in that cyber at- tacks could cause errors in the normal performance of corporate processes, with consequent inefficiencies, loss- es of customers, interruptions in power generation and of business in general.",
    "In such circumstances, the Group may not be able to conduct its normal operations in an effec- tive manner.",
    "To these challenges can be added the development of the regulatory landscape concerning cyber security, which has led to the definition of complex and at tines non-con- verging complex security requirements.",
    "Indeed, although regulations address the same objectives, they define dif- ferent formalities, deadlines and time frames, making the necessary operations costly and complex.",
    "In a similar context, for several years already Enel has ad- opted a strategic and integrated approach to the man- agement of cyber risks.",
    "More specifically, a number of ini- tiatives acting on the human factor (e.g., awareness cam- paigns and simulated phishing initiatives acting), through the implementation of technical protection solutions (e.g., antivirus, antispam, and multifactor authentication sys- tems), and for the diffusion of cyber security principles into corporate processes (eg., power plant design and maintenance, customer management and procurement) have been implemented.",

    "The unit works in synergy with the Business Lines and with the technical as ao a units responsible for system design and management, thanks to the Cyber Security Risk Managers and Cyber Security Response Managers.",
    "A valid approach to cyber risk management must also attribute responsibility to the Business Lines, facilitating well-grounded decisions on the management and posture of the risk.",
    "CISO and the Cyber Security Risk Managers also make up the Cy- ber Risks Operating Committee, which aims to evaluate cyber risks across the business and determine the risk acceptance criteria based on the Group's risk posture.",
    "The Cyber Security Committee, chaired by the Group’s CEO and made up of his/her front lines, approves the cy- ber security strategy and periodically (at least annually) checks its progress.",
    "In 2023, the Committee met once in July and for 2024 regular meetings are planned to bring the strategy forward.",
    "All areas participate actively in im- plementing the cyber security strategy by way of an inte- grated operating plan in line with the Group's objectives.",

    "In apply- ing this framework, the Cyber Security Risk Management method was also established.",
    "The method is applicable to all IT, OT and loT environments and includes all of the phases required to carry out a risk analysis and define the related mitigation plan, in line with the stated cyber secu- rity goals.",
    "To balance the advantages obtained from the operation and use of IT/OT/Iol systems with the risk that can potentially derive from them, well-informed, risk- based decisions are of fundamental importance.",
    "Enel has also created a “Cyber Emergency Readiness Team’ (CERT) to ensure proactive management and re- sponses to cyber incidents, while encouraging collabo- ration and exchanges of information within a network of accredited international partners.",
    "Having entered into an agreement with the US national CERT, there are now 9 accreditations with Romania, Italy, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Brazil, Spain and the USA.",
    "The Group’s CERT is also part of Trusted Introducer, a service that includes 508 CERTs in 75 countries.",
    "In September 2018, Enel also joined FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), the largest and most widespread community in the sector, with 710 members spread across 106 coun- tries.",

    "This leads to the need for a cyber defense model based on a systemic vision that integrates the IT sector (starting from the cloud down to the data center and mobile phone), the OT (every- thing concerning industrial sector, such as remote control of power plants) and the lol (extension of communication and Artificial Intelligence to the world of things).",
    "Through the monitoring systems, CERT collects 5 billion events every day relating to the Company's assets from 5 thousand data sources, correlates them through automat- ic analysis and on average produces daily 300 “incidents”.",
    "These incidents are classified based on the Enel Cyber Im- pact Matrix (on a scale of O to 4), making use of the best events correlation capabilities thanks to the adoption of highly advanced services.",
    "The vast majority of “incidents” are classified as O/1.",
    "These have no significant impact on Group systems and are automatically or semi-automatically blocked and/or managed by the existing Company defenses.",
    "In this way they are able to prevent and/or mitigate the impact of po- tential cyber-attacks.",
    "Incidents classified as 2/3/4 have a potential impact on the Group and are managed by CERT analysts, involving any stakeholders affected.",
    "Thanks to the protection services, each day in 2023 CERT blocked on average 1.1 million at risk emails, 46 viruses, 206 web portal attacks, and 1.6 million connections to harmful websites.",
    "During 2023 Enel's CERT replied to 48 cyber security in- cidents with impact level 2; 2 incidents with impact level 3; and 0 incidents with impact level 4, the highest one.",
    "In the cases detected, to ensure an efficient and rapid response and minimize the impact on people, services and assets, all the relevant management procedures have been put in place.",
    "Specifically, when a cyber security in- cident becomes a potential data breach, the necessary actions are taken immediately, in line with the Enel Group “Data Breach Management’ policy.",
    "Should a crisis situa- tion arise that threatens the Group's business continuity, assets, reputation and/or profitability, the appropriate ac- tions are taken immediately, in line with the specific Group policy on “Critical events management’.",

    "The program has identified common global processes and tools, which have been implemented to meet both the common requirements of all compliance issues and the specifics of local regulations.",
    "To support this process, an information system named, the “Cyber Security Global Regulatory Compliance Scheme’, has been designed and implemented to analyze the numerous regulatory requirements with respect to the Group’s Cyber Security Framework, identifying any gaps there may be both at the individual country regulatory level and at Group level.",
    "With such a tool, it is possible to effectively and efficiently identify compliance measures to be managed and monitored in the Cyber Security Regulatory Compliance program.",

    "Feedback was provided during 2023 to promote the standardization of the cur- rent cyber security regulatory landscape and the adoption of a risk-based approach and the principle of security by design.",
    "This is in view of the difficulties in managing cyber security regulations globally, which are characterized by great heterogeneity in security requirements and meth- ods of implementation.",
    "Taking into account the context of regulatory compliance, no cases of non-compliance with standards or cyber security regulations were detected in 2023.",
    "In recent years, a solid network has been established and developed by interacting with key stakeholders in the en- ergy sector such as ANEEL (Agéncia Nacional de Energia Elétrica) and ONS (Operador Nacional do Sistema Elétri- co) in Brazil and CNO (Consejo Nacional de Operacidn) in Colombia.",
    "In 2023, the Group represented Eurelectric to support the European Commission in the harmonization of cyber security legislation and standards within the En- ergy and Critical Infrastructure sector.",

    "Content Index 433 Enel welcomes the development of the EU taxonomy regulation 2020/852, as it provides a standardized, sci- ence-based classification system to identify environmen- tally sustainable economic activities.",
    "The EU taxonomy regulation acts as an important enabler to promote sustainable investments and accelerate the decarbonization of the European economy, while at the same time creating reliability and transparency for inves- tors and supporting companies in planning the Net Zero transition.",
    "Enel is committed to reporting on the implementation of Article 8 of the EU taxonomy regulation 2020/852.",
    "Fur- thermore, the Company is committed on implementing the requirements and criteria in all delegated acts issued by the European Commission by the time of publication of the Sustainability Report.",
    "Specifically, this report has been adjusted based on the following regulations: e Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 (Climate Delegated Act); e Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 of 6 July 2021 (Dis- closures Delegated Act): e Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 of 9 March 2022 (Complementary Climate Delegated Act): e Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2485 of 27 June 2023 amending the Climate Delegated Act: e Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 (Environmental Delegated Act).",
    "In particular, concerning the Climate Delegated Act, which lays out the criteria for verifying the contribution to climate mitigation and adaptation, Enel welcomes the different thresholds defined in the EU taxonomy regula- tion on the basis of climate and environmental sciences, such as the specific emission limit of 100 gCO,,,/KWh (taking the whole life cycle into consideration) to mea- sure the substantial contribution to achieving the climate change mitigation objectives established for most power generation technologies, in that it stems from a solid pro- cess based on a robust scientific foundation.",
    "However, there are some activities that, although not cov- ered under the EU taxonomy, are critical to ensuring the wellbeing of European citizens, especially in the short and medium term, while contributing to sustainable develop- ment in the long term.",
    "The EU taxonomy Climate Delegated Act has not explicitly included the segment relating to retail power sales (with 434 Sustainability Report 2023 NACE code D35.1.4), on the assumption that it does not provide a substantial contribution to climate change mit- igation.",
    "Nevertheless, retail power constitutes a funda- mental segment of the power value chain.",
    "The exclusion of such activity from the definition of a sustainable power system hinders the key role of the EU market liberaliza- tion and ultimately the efforts and value of a decarbonized end use energy consumption.",
    "Furthermore, electrifica- tion, powered by renewable energy, is the most efficient and cost-effective solution to tackle climate change as it is clean, affordable, and high performing, as well as being the only path for a truly clean energy system.",
    "Nevertheless, sustainable electrification of end energy uses requires not only clean technologies in power generation, but also power retail companies to offer renewable electricity to end customers to satisfy their energy demand.",
    "For the reasons stated above, Enel is convinced that the EU taxonomy should explicitly consider retail power activity as an eligible activity for which alignment should rely on the same criteria available for electricity production ac- tivities.",
    "In this way, Dower sales to end customers would be linked to the production source, promoting retailers to sell power from sustainable sources.",
    "This fact is even more relevant in integrated utilities that, even though operating in the power production and power retail segments with different companies within the same Group, run the busi- ness model following a comprehensive and unique view of the whole power value chain.",
    "On the other hand, on 27 June 2023, an important step forward was taken for the completion of the formative process through the publication of the new Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486, so-called Environmental Delegated Act, which sets out the technical screening criteria also for the remaining four objectives concerning the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, the pre- vention and reduction of pollution, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.",
    "Despite the relevant role of this Delegated Act for the overall sus- tainable development of the European Union, the impact on the electricity sector is much limited as most of the identified business activities do not fall within the sector, as opposite as the Climate Delegated Act.",
    "However, few non-core business activities performed by Enel have been identified due to their contribution to two environmental objectives (the protection and restoration of biodiversi- CNC ty and ecosystem and circular economy), although all of them with a marginal impact in terms of financial metrics.",
    "Going beyond the disclosure requirements of the taxono- my, Enel has included the Capex alignment percentage as one of the key performance indicators of the Sustainabili- ty-Linked Financing Framework used to define the Com- pany's sustainable financial instruments for the second consecutive year.",
    "With this important move forward, Enel The implementation process S Gil g 3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis 4 Performance 2023 reinforces the role of the taxonomy as a driver to promote sustainable investment decisions and show how sustain- ability can be fully integrated into the financial landscape.",
    "Consequently, Enel confirmed its target on the proportion of Capex aligned to the EU taxonomy equal to or higher than 80% for the period 2024-2026, according to the new Strategic Plan presented during the Capital Markets Day in November 2023.",

    "=.= Climate change adaptation: none of the business activities performed by the Group can be considered as enabling activities for climate adaptation as they do not provide adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1) (b) of the taxonomy regulation, hence no revenues can be considered eligible for this target.",
    "Nevertheless, some business activities performed by the Group are considered adapted as they include ad- aptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(a) of the taxonomy regulation.",
    "In this case capital expendi- tures and operational expenditures devoted to the ad- aptation solutions may be accounted for the climate adaptation objective.",
    "In the case of Enel, most of the adaptation solutions are inherent part of the design or refurbishment of assets that themselves are aligned to climate change mitigation objective, making it difficult to distinguish Capex/Opex from each of the two climate 436 Sustainability Report 2023 objectives (mitigation and adaptation).",
    "Therefore, and following the guidelines set out in the European Com- mission Notice 2023/305 full Capex and Opex figures have been reported under climate change mitigation objective only as this is the prevalent objective for the Group, hence avoiding any potential double counting.",

    "» The three financial metrics required by the EU taxonomy regulation (turnover, capital expenditure — Capex — and operating expenditure — Opex) were calculated accord- ing to the eligibility analysis described in the previous section.",
    "« Although not expressly required, Enel also performed an assessment in terms of the ordinary gross operating profit (EBITDA) believing that this metric represents the actual financial performance of integrated utilities such as Enel.",
    "A metric that considers only turnover is strongly influenced by the business activities with a high volume of revenues (such as the wholesale market — trading) that do not contribute proportionally to growth in the ordinary gross operating profit to the same extent as other business activities.",
    "« The financial information was gathered from the digital accounting system used by the Enel Group, or from the management systems in use by the Company's Business Lines.",
    "However, some proxies were delegated to provide a more detailed representation of the figures or to ex- clude specific activities from the overall calculation of eligible alignment (such as non-aligned hydroelectric power generation or infrastructure considered eligible but not aligned among eligible and aligned distribution network systems).",
    "For example, the following proxies were used: ~ hydroelectric: eligible non-aligned hydroelectric power plants were excluded by considering their out- put multiplied by the average turnover per unit in the years 2022 and 2023.",
    "This approach was also extend- ed to Capex, Opex and EBITDA; ~ infrastructure and networks: concerning Capex, new connections between a substation or grid and a power plant with a greenhouse gas intensity above the threshold of 100 gCO,,,/KWh were excluded con- sidering their capacity (in MW) multiplied by the aver- age Capex per unit (kE/MW) for the years 2022 and 444 Sustainability Report 2023 J ig J 2023.",
    "This approach was also extended to turnover based on the on the assets’ lifespan.",
    "Aggregate financial data in the report refer to the “sec- tor” level and include items related to third parties and inter sectorial exchanges.",
    "Financial metrics were represented by considering all electricity and gas sales as “non-eligible”.",
    "Revenues classified as eligible aligned also include in- tercompany revenues related to the sale of renewable electricity produced by the Group's generation compa- nies and sold to the Group's retail companies for mar- keting to end customers, according to the Group's inte- grated position.",
    "Capex: they cover costs that are accounted based on IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, point (h), as requested by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178.",
    "Absolute turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA correspond to the turnover/Capex/Opex/EBITDA (measured in euros) of each specific activity.",
    "The share of individual KPls corresponds to each individual economic activity in the total turnover/Capex/EBITDA of the Group (except for Opex, as the total of which refers only to the type of costs required by the taxonomy).",
    "No Capex and Opex figures that may correspond to ad- aptation solutions — in accordance with Article 11 (1) (a) of EU taxonomy regulation - in business activities that already contribute to climate mitigation have been allo- cated to climate adaptation objective, thus avoiding any potential double counting with the figures provided on climate mitigation objective.",
    "Furthermore, no revenues were considered eligible for climate adaptation objec- tive as Enel does not provide adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1) (6) of EU taxonomy reg- ulation.",
    "For those minor activities that are eligible for either the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosys- tem or the circular economy objective a rounded figure of “O” has been reported due to its insignificant weight out of overall financial figures.",

    "59.7% of ordinary EBITDA in 2023 relates to the business activities aligned to the EU taxonomy, compared to 56.7% in 2022.",
    "The EBITDA percentage of eligible taxonomy-aligned busi- ness activities increases in 2023 compared to 2022 mainly thanks to an increase in the EBITDA of renewable energy production and distribution activities in absolute terms.",
    "At the same time, there is a decrease in the EBITDA of the eligible non-aligned activities due to the thermoelectric power generation business from combined cycles, which produced lower energy volumes in 2023 compared to 2022.",
    "In 2023 33.8% of revenues are related to business activities aligned to the EU taxonomy, compared to 21.4% in 2022.",
    "In 2023, revenues decreased in absolute terms by 44.8 bil- lion euros compared to 2022.",
    "The change is mainly attrib- utable to the lower volumes of electricity produced, the lower quantities of energy sold in the wholesale and retail markets, as well as the decrease in average selling pric- es of commodities, thus impacting non-eligible and non- aligned activities.",
    "At the same time, an increase in revenues related to the production of energy from renewable sources was ob- served in 2023, resulting in an increase in absolute terms of revenues in aligned activities from 30.6 billion euros in 2022 to 33.1 billion euros in 2023.",
    "These phenomena con- tributed to the increase in the percentage weight of rev- enues from EU taxonomy-aligned activities by 12% year- on-year.",

    "This increase is mainly due to high- er investments in energy storage systems through BESS (Battery Energy Storage Systems) and a reduction in in- vestments in non-eligible or non-aligned thermoelectric technologies.",
    "The actual 2023 Capex for eligible aligned assets is 4.0% higher than the Capex planned for 2023 in the Strategic Plan 2023-2025 for the same assets.",
    "This change is main- ly due to higher investments in absolute terms in eligible aligned renewable and distribution activities than planned (approximately 1.9 billion euros).",
    "68.4% of operating expenses (Opex) in 2023 relate to business activities aligned to the EU taxonomy, compared to 66.9% in 2022.",

    "Issued as part of Enel and Enel Fi- nance International's Euro Medium-Term Note Programme (EMTN Programme), the Green Bonds are targeted at in- stitutional investors and guaranteed by Enel SpA.",
    "The net proceeds of the issue were used to finance or refinance projects in the categories identified in line with the “Green Bond Principles” published by ICMA (International Capital Market Association).",
    "In particular, the proceeds were used to finance: e new projects for the development, construction and re- powering of generation plants from renewable sources (Green Bond emission in 2017 and 2019); e new projects for the development, construction, re- powering and refinancing of generation plants from renewable sources as well as projects for transmis- sion, networks and smart grids (Green Bond emission in 2018).",
    "In this regard, it should be noted that during 2023 it be- came necessary to reallocate proceeds totaling 229.60 million euros, following the Group's deconsolidation of three projects”: the reallocation took place to two renew- able projects, Seven Cowboy (USA) for 174.22 million euros and Alta Farms II for 55.38 million euros®), In order to facilitate the transparency and quality of the Green Bonds issued, the Enel Group has prepared and published specific “Green Bond Frameworks” for each year of emission, whose compliance with the reference principles has been confirmed by an external advisor, Vi- geo Eiris (now Moody's Investors Service), which issued the so-called “Second Party Opinion”.",
    "Within the frameworks, the categories relating to eligible projects are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN SDG), in particular Goals 7, 9, 11 and 13°) The reference documents for the three emissions are available on the Enel Group's website (https://www.enel.",
    "com/investors/investing/sustainable-finance/green- bonds).",
    "The Enel Group is among the first companies in the world having set up a “Green Bond Committee” with the aim of selecting projects and monitoring the progress of their development.",
    "The reporting document hereof, published for the seventh time in 2023, meets Enel’s commitment undertaken at the time of the bond issuance to report an- nually on the use of proceeds, on the environmental bene- fits deriving from the projects financed and on further ESG metrics linked to these projects.",
    "The indicators were determined in accordance with the “Green Bond Framework” (December 2016, December 2017 and November 2018) principles and shown in the ta- ble based on the type of project and the specific year of emission of the Green Bonds.",
    "Furthermore, all of the plant technologies as well as Grids activities in Italy for which the proceeds of the Green Bonds issued in 2017 2018 and 2019 were allocated are to be considered eligible and aligned activities according to European taxonomy (Eu- ropean Regulation 2020/852).",
    "In order to improve trans- parency and facilitate understanding of reporting over the years, the report also provides the following information: e 2017 Green Bond reporting with evidence of projects relating to renewable plants.",
    "Seven plants also contrib- ute toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 Green Bond following new investments (Capex) that were made; e 2018 Green Bond reporting with evidence of projects related to: — renewable plants, three of which contribute toward the allocation of the proceeds of the 2019 Green Bond due to new investments (Capex) that were made; — “refinancing” of renewable plants due to the replace- ment of previous credit lines; (1) Cremzow (Germany) for -9.24 million euros on Green Bond 2018; Kafireas (Greece) for -63.50 million euros on Green Bond 2018 and -125.93 million euros on Green Bond 2019, for a total of -189.43 million euros; Cohuna (Australia) for -30.93 million euros on Green Bond 2019.",
    "(2) Seven Cowboy (USA) for 72.74 million euros on Green Bond 2018; Seven Cowboy (USA) for 101.48 million euros and Alta Farms II (USA) for 55.38 million euros on Green Bond 2019, for a total of 156.86 million euros.",

    "Finally, in agreement with what is required by the cited Green Bond Framework, this document consists of the following indicated below.",
    "Summary table of 2017, 2018 and 2019 emissions with indication of the installed capacity and the cumulative CO, avoided for all years of Green Bond reporting.",
    "Table A “Financial indicators”, which reports: — the capacity and amount of the “foreign currency in- vestment” approved by the Board of Directors and/ or the Investment Committee, and communicated to the financial market through specific press releases; — the value of the “investment in euros”, calculated by considering the average exchange rate for the years 2017-2019 (for projects defined in 2017), the average exchange rate for the years 2018-2020 (for projects defined in 2018) and/or the average exchange rate for the years 2019-2021 (for projects defined in 2019) of Enel’s Industrial Plan; — the share of the Green Bond proceeds allocated to the project as the difference between the total capi- talized costs as at December 31, 2017, December 31, 2018 and/or December 31, 2019 and the amount of third-party financing associated to the specific proj- ect.",
    "The amounts of proceeds allocated to the proj- ects in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively were used in the same years; — the date of entry into operation corresponding to the time when the plant produced the first kWh.",
    "In this regard, it should be noted that all of the plants asso- ciated with the three Green Bonds have entered into operation.",
    "Table B “ESG indicators” which shows the environmen- tal benefit in terms of actual CO, avoided.",
    "In particular, with reference to: renewable projects: — the quantity of effective generation (with the excep- (4) 3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis 4 Performance 2023 tion of the repowering plants whose share of gener- ation cannot be separated from the rest of the plant); — the quantity of actual CO, avoided determined by multiplying the effective generation by the emission factor linked to the specific thermoelectric power generation of the country in which the plant is locat- ed (emission factors source: Enerdata - February 22, 2024 release): — the cumulative value of effective generation and the relative CO, avoided for the entire years of Green Bond reporting; Enel Grids projects, the following indicators are also provided: — the cabling ratio, determined by the ratio between the length of the cable lines and the total length of the lines.",
    "The increase in this index over time is due to an increase in the length of the overhead and under- ground cable line to the detriment of bare conduc- tors; in particular, the main environmental benefits concern the containment of plant cutting activities and a drastic reduction in the risk of electrocution and collision for birds; — network automation, which corresponds to the ratio between RCP (Remote Controlled Point) and medi- um/low-voltage equipment: — technical network losses, mainly related to the char- acteristics/functions of the network.",
    "These loss- es are usually calculated using statistical models or benchmarks.",
    "A reduction in technical network losses results in a reduction in the energy to be generated and a consequent reduction in emissions and con- sumption of raw materials; — the elimination of oil equipment with PCB reduces the risk of contamination of acompound no longer in production since the 1980s and classified as ecotoxic and bioaccumulable; — energy savings are represented in terms of “ener- gy saved\" in MWh in place of the CO, avoided (t) to specifically report the improvement in efficiency ob- tained thanks to the use of so-called “in ecodesign” transformers and the optimization of MV grids as the difference between losses detected before and after these interventions.",

    "Green Bond Report 2023 — supporting notes 5 Appendix party opinion’, the following indicators for the renew- able projects: — water consumption related to data reported for the plants in only the period following their entry into operation (from the moment there are no plants financed by the Green Bonds with the “under con- struction” status); — projects for protecting biodiversity promoted by Enel in connection to the operation of the plant; — the cases in which the site stopped its operations (plant shutdown) due to environmental management issues and their impact: — fatalities or high consequence (\"Life Changing”) in- juries to Enel people; — activities and projects carried out to support local communities in the areas surrounding the plant.",
    "The indicator related to the number of beneficiaries of these projects refers to the people involved by such activity or project.",
    "The above indicators in Table C, with the exception of water consumption and plant shutdown due to envi- ronmental issues, also refer to Enel Grids projects.",
    "e Table D “Overall information” which provides the crite- ria, indicators, overall information and approach chosen by Enel to develop the projects financed through the proceeds of the bond.",
    "The data have been thoroughly calculated on the ba- sis of the results of Enel’s accounting, non-accounting and other information systems, and validated by the persons responsible in each case.",

    "486 Sustainability Report 2023 Claicl' Worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continued to increase in 2023, largely due to the economic rebound and a further increase in fossil fuel consumption, with the energy crisis and high natural gas and liquefied natural gas prices triggering an increased use of unabated coal as a cheaper but more emissive fuel.",
    "The Group, however, managed to reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions across its entire value chain by 26.3% overall, compared to the previous year.",
    "In addition, the Group also reduced its Scope 1 GHG emissions In- tensity relating to Power Generation by more than 30.1%, from 229 gCO,,,/KWh in 2022 down to 160 gCO,,./kKWh in 2023.",
    "Such reduction was the result of a 12.9% increase of consolidated renewables production and a 375% re- duction of consolidated thermoelectric production, com- pared to 2022, as consequence of the Group's strategy of shifting its energy mix portfolio towards renewables and advancing in its decarbonization process.",
    "Nevertheless, the war in Ukraine and the consequent re- strictions in EU gas imports from Russia, which caused a decrease in gas availability accompanied by a surge in the wholesale prices of electricity and gas with severe effects for households and businesses, led the EU governments to implement a range of policy responses to mitigate the im- pact of higher costs and ensure the energy systems stability.",
    "In particular, the Italian government responded with a national natural gas consumption containment plan that included, among its measures, the maximization of elec- tricity production in the thermoelectric sector using fu- els other than gas.",
    "This was achieved through the Decree 14/2022 that required the country’s national transmission system operator (TSO) to define a program aimed at max- imizing power generation from coal-fired power plants until the end of September 2023.",
    "Consequently, the TSO identified Enel's coal-fired power plants as essential and required them to maximize their production.",
    "On the other hand, in Spain, the government authorization for the closure of As Pontes coal power plant requested by Enel's subsidiary Endesa in December 2019 for June 2021 was postponed until the end of 2023 as the power plant was 3 Stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis 4 Performance 2023 identified as essential by the transmission system operator.",
    "As aconsequence of the unprecedented crisis that the Eu- ropean energy system faced in 2022 and 2023, the Group's emission reduction carried out in 2023 was not enough to meet the Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation target set for 2023 and announced at the Cap- ital Markets Day held in November 2020 for the launch of the 2021-2023 Strategic Plan.",
    "Due to the energy crisis, the intensity figure stood slightly higher than the target of 148 gCO,,,/KWh.",
    "In absence of the above-mentioned effect, Enel would have been able to achieve an intensity emission level well below the 148 gCO,,,/KWh target.",
    "As a consequence, the Group's Sustainability-Linked in- struments which set the Scope 1 Power Generation In- tensity target of 148 gCO,,,/KWh for 2023 will be subject to an increase of the relevant margin and Enel will comply with its obligations in accordance with the terms and con- ditions of the legal documentation of such Sustainabili- ty-Linked transactions.",
    "Despite these unprecedented circumstances, the Group's emissions intensity in 2023 remained aligned with the 1.5 °C pathway.",
    "In fact, the sector's decarbonization approach of the SBTi established a maximum threshold of 246 gCO,,,/ kWh for Enel for 2023, well above the actual figure.",
    "Ultimately, Enel’s decarbonization commitment remains confirmed for both the short, medium and long term, as envisaged in the new 2024-2026 Strategic plan, which es- tablishes a new short-term target for 2026 of 125 gCO,,,/ kWh.",
    "This new target has been included in the Sustain- ability-Linked Financing Framework updated in January 2024 and linked to the first launch of Sustainability-Linked bonds in 2024, confirming Enel’s commitment towards the energy transition as well as contributing to the environ- mental and financial sustainability of the Group’s develop- ment strategy.",
    "Furthermore, the target for 2030 to reduce 80% of the GHG scope 1 intensity from power generation with respect to 2017 baseline and the final target for 2040 aimed at reducing 100% of these emissions without rely- ing on any type of offset or carbon removal mechanism remain confirmed as well.",

    "Hydrogen can be produced from a wide range of energy sources, including both traditional and renewable.",
    "Until now, 99% has been obtained from fossil fuels globally.",
    "They are called grey hydrogen (produced from the steam reforming of natural gas), blue hydrogen (the same as grey, but capturing a part of the carbon dioxide emitted in the process), or brown hydrogen (produced from of mineral or vegetable coal).",
    "The main characteristic of green hydrogen is that, once generated from the electrolysis of the water molecule through electrical energy from renewable sources, it becomes an energy carrier, since it can be recombined with oxygen to produce electrical energy in the so-called hydrogen fuel cells.",
    "In this way, hydrogen is an energy vector that perfectly complements electricity to store and transport energy.",
    "In addition, it is flammable and its combustion produces large amounts of heat, so it has the potential to displace natural gas and coal, and thus decarbonize some industrial and residential sectors that cannot be electrified.",
    "The European Hydrogen Strategy highlights the decarbonisation of hydrogen production as an essential element to support the EU's commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.",
    "Hydrogen produced from renewable sources is neutral in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.",
    "greenhouse in its production and consumption and, unlike other renewable energy vectors such as batteries, supercapacitors or flywheels, it has the capacity to be stored in the form of a chemical molecule, which does not have self-discharge and establishes a high interest in this energy sector with a view to long-term renewable energy storage.",
    "Additionally, the applications of hydrogen are not limited only to purely energy ones, in the form of reelectrification or heat, since this molecule is used as a raw material in many industrial processes, offering a wide diversity of future business models for the decarbonization of an wide variety of sectors.",

    "However, it was decided to consider these modifications in subsequent evaluations given that the expectation is that these changes will benefit the employee, that is, increase the value of the plan.",
    "The main features of the plan at the end of 2023 are as follows: m The plan is made up of two tranches, both tranches being in force.",
    "First accrual period: January 1, 2021 to January 2, 2023; and, Second accrual period: January 3, 2023 to January 4, 2025; having set the targets for the first year of accrual 2023.",
    "m The entry into force of the plan coincides with the dates of concession to each of the employees, between January 1, 2021 and May 20, 2021 for the first tranche, and the date of concession of each of the employees during the month of June 2023 for tranche 2.",
    "m The vesting of the right to receive the shares is conditional upon compliance, during each of the accrual periods, with the following conditions: Necessary condition of permanence in the participant's employment; That the Beneficiary achieves a minimum rating in the performance evaluation carried out in each accrual period.",
    "That the Beneficiary achieves a minimum % of the individual and area annual targets during the accrual period.",
    "The number of shares to be delivered to each of the participants will be determined based on the gradual achievement of certain performance ratios of the Group, associated with the total return obtained by the shareholder, EBITDA and ESG (Free cash flow in the initial plan) .",
    "Soltec INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 2023 Soltec These performance ratios will be calculated over the period from January 1 to December 31 of each of the annual instalments included in the accrual periods.",
    "m The delivery of the shares will occur at the end of the deferral period of 365 days after the end of each accrual period, with the exception of the 30 thousand euros that are delivered in cash.",
    "m Performance targets will be set by the board for each year.",
    "As of the closing date of 2023, the targets for 2021, 2022 and 2023 have been set.",
    "Said incentive plan, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 2 “Share-Based Payments’, is considered a plan settled in shares (equity-settled), with the exception of a beneficiary whose plan contemplates a portion as cash-settled for a value of 30 thousand euros.",
    "At the end of the 2023 fiscal year for the new grant of tranche 2 share package corresponding to the years 2023 and 2024, personnel expenses totalling 474 thousand euros were accrued with a balancing entry in the Group's equity discounted by 30 thousand euros for the cash-settled share plan, the balancing entry for which is a liability account.",
    "For the 2022 financial year, there was a positive adjustment for the incentive plan in the amount of 1,953 thousand euros with a balancing entry in the Group's equity discounted by 30,000 euros for the cash-settled share plan, the balancing entry for which is a liability account.",
    "The recognition of this income was due to the partial reversal of the provision recorded for the year 2021, since the degree of compliance with the conditions entitling to receive the remuneration had been lower than initially considered.",
    "This tranche is fully accrued, only pending settlement.",
    "As of December 31, 2023, the number of existing concessions at a consolidated level amounts to 947,370 shares (1,287,037 shares at the end of 2022) and associated with tranche 1 with a total of 619,113 shares (646,897 shares at the end of 2022).",
    "The value of tranche 1 expected to be settled amounts to 944 thousand euros and will be settled next January 2024.",
    "Valuation of share delivery plan linked to performance conditions.",
    "Based on the work carried out by an independent expert, they have estimated that the fair value of the plan at the initial time amounts to 12,346 thousand euros.",
    "Said valuation was carried out considering the market price of the Group's shares on the date of granting the plan and based on the assumptions made by the Company's directors for which it was expected that none of the employees benefiting from the plan would leave and all employees would achieve the required qualification and target achievement rate.",
    "Likewise, the valuation has taken into account the estimate of the degree of achievement of the Group's performance based on its financial projections and established targets, the estimate of the price per share and the discount periods based on the periods of accrual.",
    "Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and other persons rendering similar services are recorded at the fair value of the equity instruments granted on the grant date.",
    "This valuation is plans are disclosed in note 17.2.",
    "The fair value of the equity instruments granted, determined on the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments, is recognized as a personnel expense over the vesting period, with a simultaneous recognition of a reserve relating to the incentive plans for the same amount in equity, based on the estimate of the final number of equity instruments to be granted as a result of the fulfilment of the necessary conditions other than market conditions.",
    "In this way, the initially calculated value is adjusted based on the number of beneficiaries expected to remain in the company at the time of delivery of the equity instruments as well as based on the fulfilment of market performance conditions.",
    "At year-end, the Group revises the estimate of the number of equity instruments it expects to grant based on the evolution of the necessary conditions other than market conditions.",
    "The impact of the revision of the original estimate, if any, is recognized in income so that the cumulative expense reflects the amount accrued at the date of the revised estimate based on the new fair value of the equity instruments granted, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.",
    "Unlike equity-settled plans, for cash-settled share-based payments, the expense recorded is recognized against a liability for the goods or services acquired, initially measured at fair value.",
    "At year-end, until the liability is settled and also at the settlement date, the fair value of the liability is re-estimated, recording any change against the consolidated income statement for the year.",

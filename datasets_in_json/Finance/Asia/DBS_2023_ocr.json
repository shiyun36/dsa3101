    "Challenges were abundant.",
    "The war between Russia and Ukraine raged on, additional armed conflicts broke out, most notably between Israel and Hamas, and tensions between the superpowers remained high.",
    "All these complicated geopolitics further and contributed to economic headwinds.",
    "While inflation eased after global central banks aggressively hiked rates, it persisted at elevated levels.",
    "Consequently, both consumers and businesses continued to face significant strain.",
    "Despite this, a hard landing of the global economy was avoided.",
    "In particular, most of Asia’s economies remained robust.",
    "China and India, the two most populous economies of the world, both ended the year with a higher growth Approach Pillar 1 Responsible Banking rate than in 2022.",
    "And the outlook for Southeast Asian economies improved, as the electronics export cycle bottomed out and travel and tourism continued to recover.",
    "On the climate front, we witnessed an unprecedented number of new records this past year.",
    "June to December were the warmest months on record.",
    "Ocean temperatures were the hottest ever measured.",
    "All of this has been exacerbated by the start of El Nifo, a natural climate shift that tends to raise global temperatures.",
    "But the science is clear, the trajectory of global warming can only be changed if we reduce historically hign atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations at soeed and scale.",

    "The number of people directly impacted by these calamities reached new highs, with the poor disproportionately affected, worsening social inequalities.",
    "Encouragingly, governments and regulators around the world have implemented an increasing number of meaningful policies that support the transition to net zero, which is being complemented by significant efforts of the private sector to transform global industries and supply chains.",
    "Globally, investments in clean energy overtook spending on fossil fuel at a ratio of 1.7:1, according to the International Energy Agency.",
    "Just five years ago, this ratio stood at 1:1.",
    "Additionally, 118 countries pledged at the COP28 climate summit to triple the world’s renewable energy capacity by 2030.",
    "The electrification of transport has greatly accelerated across markets, and battery production has been scaling up.",

    "From ambition to action Against this backdrop, we further refined our approach and leveraged the increased capacity we had built in previous years to double down on various strategic initiatives.",
    "Our sustainability strategy remains centred around embedding environmental and social considerations into the fabric of our business via three pillars: (1) Responsible Banking that seeks to empower our clients to being more sustainable and to promote greater access to essential financial services, (2) Responsible Business Practices that focuses on how we conduct ourselves as an organisation, and (3) Impact Beyond Banking that supports social enterprises and community causes, as well as employee volunteerism.",

    "We continue to advance our sustainability agenda through a proactive and multifaceted approach that focuses on minimising negative environmental impact rather than relying on reactive measures like purchasing offsets.",
    "By adopting a life-cycle perspective, we strive to identify and address environmental challenges at every stage of our operations.",
    "To address our carbon, energy, water and waste footprint, we have developed a four-lever approach to systematically drive progress based on prioritising our efforts in the following order: e Lever 1: Reduce consumption of resources e Lever 2: Generate renewable energy e Lever 3: Purchase green products and energy e Lever 4: Purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets Note on data quality and coverage To improve our data quality, we are continually enhancing our data governance, systems, and processes.",

    "Energy reduction and management approach We reduce our energy consumption through a series of operational energy reduction and efficiency initiatives.",
    "In 2023, we successfully converted four branches in India to operate at a net-zero-energy level, namely, T Nagar, Dindigul (Branch Premises), Vashi and Nagapattinam branches.",
    "We have designed net-zero-energy retrofits for these and other offices in our portfolio, and we are assessing implementation of these retrofits.",
    "We also consistently install occupancy sensors for lights and cooling in all new Spaces whenever feasible, in line with our principle of using energy only where necessary.",
    "At present, over 80% of our manned retail branches in Singapore are certified Green Buildings.",

    "The CSA translates the effects of policy and regulation changes, technology develooment and changes in consumer preferences as defined by a set of standard climate scenarios (for example, from the Network of Greening the Financial System (NGFS)) into impacts to key financial drivers identified for each sector.",
    "The CSA is based on a bottom-up approach where relevant company and industry information such as company financials and emissions data are used to determine the impact on the company’s credit rating, leveraging on the NGEFS scenarios.",
    "Scenario data include, for example, primary, Secondary, and final energy consumption, emissions data, carbon price, price indices for key energy variables.",
    "Tne data used are sector-specific and may be further expanded to capture key dynamics of specific sectors.",
    "A total of nine sectors selected based on their significance within the IBG portfolio and carbon emissions contribution were included in the transition risk scenario analyses.",
    "These include Power, Oil and Gas, Automotive, Aviation, Shipping, Real Estate, Steel, Chemicals, as well as Food and Agribusiness.",
    "We used relevant company financials and industry- specific data to perform the bottom-up modelling for each company.",
    "The methodology identifies and assesses how key drivers such as production volume, unit cost of production, Selling price, capital expenditure and asset value, impact the financial statements of companies and consequently changes to credit ratings over the forecast horizon.",
    "To assess the rest of the portfolio not covered by the CSA models, a top-down analysis was conducted whereby companies were selected based on their materiality, data availability and representativeness of the sector.",
    "Key insights (1) Source: IPCC AR6 Report Scenario models Sector-agnostic transition parameters Emissions and climate forcing * Carbon price * Emissions intensity Climate impacts As example: * Growth rate of different modes of transportation * Information on power plants * Battery cost Climate projections Socioeconomic information derived from these companies in the bottom-up analysis were then extrapolated to the rest of the corporate lending portfolio.",
    "Physical risk The forward-looking physical risk analysis is conducted based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) as described below: ¢ Very high climate change scenario (SSP5-8.5): Low mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions triple by 2075 and global average temperatures rise by 3.3-5.7 °C by 2100.",
    "e High climate change scenario (SSP3-7.0): Limited mitigation scenario in which total greennouse gas emissions double by 2100 and global average temperatures rise by 2.8-4.6 °C by 2100.",
    "e Intermediate climate change scenario (SSP2-4.5).: Strong mitigation scenario in which total greennouse gas emissions stabilise around current levels until 2050 and then decline but not reaching net zero by 2100.",
    "This scenario is expected to result in global average temperatures rising by 2.1-3.5 °C by 2100.",
    "Key drivers Capital expenditure Company-level financial Credit score model statements (scenario-adjusted) Volume Income statement Internal credit Balance sheet rating model Cash flow statement Asset value e Low climate change scenario (SSP1-2.6): Aggressive mitigation scenario in which total greenhouse gas emissions reduce to net zero by 2050, resulting in global average temperatures rising by 1.3-2.4 °C by 2100.",
    "Limitations Climate risk scenario analysis is an important tool to assess the resilience of a bank’s business models and strategies to arange of plausible climate related pathways, and to determine the impact of climate-related risk drivers on overall risk profile.",
    "Outcome of scenario analysis can also be used to assess the risk implications of various decarbonisation pathways and deviations therefrom.",
    "Meanwhile, since the area of climate scenario analysis and the associated modelling is still evolving and an industry standard has yet to emerge, it is important that the uncertainties and limitations associated with climate scenario analysis are understood to ensure that the results are interpreted and used appropriately: 1) Climate scenarios: With the growth in scenario analysis use cases, and as industry practitioners and regulators gain more insights therefrom, ongoing updates and Additional Disclosures CONTENTS improvements of the scenarios are expected and noted on NGFS scenarios.",
    "Users will need to understand the implications and adjust the models accordingly.",
    "2) Extended horizon: Time horizon of over 30 years is typical of scenario analysis (e.¢g., transition risk analysis typically goes to at least 2050 to align with net zero goal horizon, while physical risk analysis can be of longer Norizon).",
    "This is much longer than typical business planning horizon, with uncertainties arising from technological develooment, demographic change, and climate tioping point events, among others.",
    "3) Data: Bottom-up firm level analysis requires granular data such as absolute emissions or intensity for various scope of a firm's activities, wnich currently varies in terms of availability, granularity, and accuracy.",
    "4) Methodology: Modelling practices are still evolving in the absence of market standards, in particular on physical risk modelling due to the heaw reliance on good quality location-specific data and hazard estimates.",
    "With the ongoing improvement of data availability and Updates in scenarios and tools available in the market, it is expected that the methodology of modelling the transmission mechanism of climate related financial risks be further fine-tuned over time.",
    "With the focus on climate risk scenario analysis by the industry and regulators, it is expected that continuous effort will be invested to address such limitations over the next couple of years.",

    "We performed our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information and, in respect of greenhouse gas emissions included in the Identified Sustainability Information, Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 - Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements (collectively, the “Standards”).",
    "These Standards require that we plan and perform our work to form the conclusion about whether the Identified Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement.",
    "The extent of our procedures depends on our professional judgment and our assessment of the engagement risk.",
    "A limited assurance engagement involves assessing the suitability in the circumstances of the Company's use of the Reporting Criteria as the basis for the preparation of the Identified Sustainability Information, assessing the risks of material misstatement of the Identified Sustainability Information whether due to fraud or error, responding to the assessed risks as necessary in the circumstances, and evaluating the overall presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.",

    "The procedures selected included inquiries, observation of processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records.",
    "Given the circumstances of the engagement, we also performed the following: e interviewed management and personnel in Group Procurement Services, Group Human Resources, and Corporate Real Estate Strategy & Administration in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information; ¢ obtained an understanding of how the Identified Sustainability Information is gathered, collated and aggregated internally; ¢ performed limited substantive testing, on a selective basis, of the Identified Sustainability Information (i) to verify the assumptions, estimations and computations made in relation to the Selected Sustainability Information; and (ii) to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported, to the extent we considered necessary and appropriate to provide sufficient evidence for our conclusion; and e assessed the disclosure and presentation of the Identified Sustainability Information.",
    "The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, areasonable assurance engagement.",
    "Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is Substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.",
    "Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the Company's Identified Sustainability Information has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.",
    "Inherent Limitations In designing these procedures, we considered the system of internal controls in relation to the Identified Sustainability Information and reliance has been placed on internal controls where appropriate.",
    "Because of the inherent limitations in any accounting and internal control system, errors and irregularities may nevertheless occur and not be detected.",
    "The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure subject matter allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities.",
    "The quantification of the greenhouse gas emissions data underlying the Identified Sustainability Information is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases, and the estimation uncertainty from the measurement and calculation processes used to quantify emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.",

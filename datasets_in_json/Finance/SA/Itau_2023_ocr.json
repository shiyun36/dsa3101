    "In line with our commitment to reduce the use of gases which are harmful to the ozone layer, as described by the Montreal Protocol, we have implemented projects to replace HCFC-22 gas in the air conditioning units of branches and administrative buildings, reducing the consumption of this fluid by 39% in 2023, a reduction of 5,177 tCO,e.",

    "To this end, we try both to improve technology and to build the awareness of the maintenance team and our suppliers regarding reducing fluid leaks into the atmosphere according to the benchmarks for each type of equipment.",
    "Data Management In our quest to improve the measurement of our emissions, we started to use Salesforce as a tool for reporting fluid refills, which allows us to understand the individual performance of the branches, which will inform our decision-making depending on the issues detected.",
    "Supplier Literacy Workshops We held a workshop on assumptions, data, metrics and the use of Salesforce to build the ESG literacy and engagement of our four managers and 14 branch maintenance service suppliers, while supporting their management work and advising them on the correct reporting of fluid recharge data in relation to air conditioning maintenance.",

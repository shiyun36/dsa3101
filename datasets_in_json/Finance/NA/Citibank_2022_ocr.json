    "Citi 2022 ESG Report Page 27 Achieving Sector Targets We are continuing to focus on client engagement as acritical step in the implementation of our Net Zero Plan.",
    "One of our ongoing engagement priorities is to identify clients with high- emissions footprints and engage in climate- related discussions, such as emissions reduction plans.",
    "To aid these efforts, we are piloting a Net Zero Review Template.",
    "This assessment identifies gaps and provides a roadmap for prioritizing engagement where it is most needed.",
    "The Template uses some of the same inputs as our Climate Risk Assessment & Scorecard (CRAS), including absolute emissions and emissions intensity data, as well as disclosed targets and the climate score output from our CRAS.",
    "The Template also includes questions about clients’ decarbonization plans, including factors such as governance, scope (what emissions categories are included), capital expenditure plans and asset retirement schedules (where available/applicable), among others.",
    "The results of this analysis will help to guide our strategy and prioritization for client engagement.",
    "During 2022, we began piloting this tool for our Energy and Power portfolios, and we plan to have Net Zero Review Templates for additional sectors as we set more interim emissions reduction targets.",
    "Developing Sector Targets The PCAF methodology informs our calculation of absolute financed emissions.",
    "We calculate absolute financed emissions metrics in two ways: @® Committed funds: the capital available to a client for a certain use Citi 2022 ESG Report Climate Risk & Net Zero | Sustainable Operations ® Outstanding funds: the funds actually drawn down on such available credit (per PCAF Standard) For the purposes of understanding our absolute financed emissions, forward-looking emissions management and establishing absolute and intensity targets for applicable sectors, we rely on the first of these approaches: total committed exposure.",
    "This more accurately reflects the maximum amount that Citi has agreed to finance for clients, although we provide both metrics for transparency.",
    "Obtaining more reliable and actionable climate data continues to be achallenge, and we have been supportive of regulatory developments to ensure more consistent, comparable and reliable climate disclosures.",
    "At the time of the analysis disclosed in this report, the data available for calculating financed emissions and emissions intensity and measuring progress was nearly two years old.",
    "For example, the baseline metrics for the 2030 targets we set for the Auto Manufacturing, Commercial Real Estate, Steel and Thermal Coal Mining sectors were developed using 2020 emissions data, which was the most recent data available at the time we began the analysis.",
    "This lag time means our metrics are based on out-of-date data, and may delay our ability to confirm progress against our interim targets in a timely fashion.",
    "We hope that the data will improve as consistency develops in disclosures of key environmental metrics, and that as the lag is reduced we will be able to more accurately present progress against our 2030 targets closer to the target year.",
    "Citi plans to review our emissions reductions targets periodically, post 2025, as the energy Building Equitable & ResilientCommunities _| transition evolves.",
    "We will continue to be trans- parent about the impacts of the data lag while moving forward with our climate commitments.",
    "As disclosed regarding our approach to net zero, after calculating our baseline, we assess an appropriate metric (absolute or intensity) and benchmark against sector-relevant scenarios to set targets.",
    "For more information on metric selection, please see our 2022 TCFD Report.",
    "Update on Interim Targets for Our Energy and Power Portfolios Last year, we reported on our initial Net Zero Plan for our Energy and Power portfolios, including baseline financed emissions and interim 2030 reduction targets for the two sectors.",
    "The table below provides an update on our progress during the first year following the establishment of those targets.",
    "For an overview of all our net zero targets set to date, see the Talent&DEI | Responsible Business Appendices 2030 Emissions Reduction Targets table on the following page.",
    "There are anumber of contributors to fluctua- tions in financed emissions from year to year, including credit exposure, the company value (Enterprise Value Including Cash [EVIC] for public companies, Debt and Equity for private companies), and the company emissions.",
    "We saw these dynamics play out last year, particularly in the Energy sector, where the data mismatch between high, 2021 year-end energy company valuation and decreased, 2020 production and emissions resulted in lower financed emissions figures for 2021.",
    "In an effort to adjust for one of these superficial drivers, we have tested a proposed PCAF EVIC adjustment method (intended for asset managers’ portfolios) to create a normalized metric by calculating an adjustment factor based on the portfolio EVIC fluctuation.",

    "Our most recent alignment score, based on 2021 data, illustrates slightly less alignment, up to +12.2% from +11.7% (a higher score represents greater misalignment with the Principles).",
    "Our score was impacted by our clients’ operational priorities as well as the residual impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the effect of port congestion and demandin the container sector, as well as the tentative resumption of the cruise industry in 2021.",
    "The cruise segment represented +6.3% of our total alignment score of +12.2%.",
    "Our cargo alignment score was also impacted in 2021 due to the significant tonnage demand increase in dry cargo, as well as the pre-existing issues in the container sector.",

    "& Citi 2022 ESG Report Operational Footprint Goals We began reporting on our direct operational impacts in 2002.",
    "With this report, we are disclosing progress against our 2025 opera- tional footprint goals through year-end 2022.",
    "These goals are aligned with a pathway to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C and cover greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy use, water consumption, waste reduction and diversion, and sustainable building design.",
    "Working toward these goals also helps us make progress toward our net zero commitment for Citi operations.",
    "Our facilities were not used at full capacity in 2022, as impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic continued to varying degrees around the world.",
    "In addition, as Citi employees return to the office, the majority are transitioning to a hybrid work model, which includes working remotely up to two days a week.",
    "As a result, facility-related resource consumption, waste generation and GHG emissions were lower than they otherwise would have been.",
    "We recognize that some of these impacts were shifted to employees’ homes and other non-Citi facilities.",
    "As aresult of having fewer people using Citi buildings, our progress for 2022 indicates that we exceeded some of our goals during the year.",
    "That trend could briefly reverse in the coming years, as our employees continue to return to the office and transition to our new work model, before progressing again toward meeting our goals.",
    "Maintaining 100% renewable electricity is one of our 2025 operational footprint goals, and itis a key driver in helping us meet our net zero commitment for our operations.",
    "With our global footprint, it can be challenging to source renewable electricity consistently, especially with the current volatility in global energy markets.",
    "We focus on sourcing renewable electricity from within the same market boundary as our facilities and from our local utilities.",
    "When these two options are not practical, we source renewable electricity from nearby markets.",
    "Our aim is to move toward additional local sourcing or on-site generation as it becomes feasible.",

    "Citi 2022 ESG Report Building Equitable & ResilientCommunities _| Net Zero Commitment Our commitment to achieve net zero GHG emis- sions by 2050 includes both our financing and our own operations.",
    "For our operations, we are targeting net zero emissions by 2030.",
    "Our emissions reduction efforts and renewable electricity use put us well on the path to net zero for our operations.",
    "Challenges remain in addressing the direct emissions from the diesel generators we use for backup power and the natural gas we use for the heat and power system at our global headquarters and, to a lesser extent, for heating and cooking across our global oper- ations.",
    "Addressing these emissions will require a combination of electrification, low-carbon alternative fuels and carbon removals for hard- to-abate emissions.",
    "In 2022, we expanded our GHG screening inven- tory to include Scope 3 emissions associated with our supply chain and our employee activities (i.e., business travel, commuting and working from home) from 2019 through 2021.",
    "This GHG screening inventory is available in our 2022 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report.",
    "Limitations in data availability and quality continue to require the use of Talent&DEI | Responsible Business spend-based and industry average emissions factors and limit our ability to make decisions about low- or no-carbon alternatives.",
    "To that end, we have updated our Statement of Supplier Principles, and we encourage our suppliers to track and report emissions.",
    "We hope this will help us identify opportunities for engagement with suppliers.",
    "Additionally, our zero-carbon-ready building principles and our ongoing work to achieve our 2025 operational footprint goals, which include targets for reducing GHG emissions and energy consumption for our operations, help support our net zero commitment.",
    "In 2022, Citi purchased voluntary third-party verified carbon credits consisting of a portfolio of nature-based, energy efficiency and methane destruction credits in an amount equivalent to our Scope 1 direct GHG emissions.",

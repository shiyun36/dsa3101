    "While the bank has a track record of prudently managing financial risk, we are still building capability in the management of non-financial risk (NFR).",
    "This has been emphasised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) requiring ANZ to hold an additional operational risk capital overlay, due to concerns about our progress in this space, including issues within our Markets business.",

    "The actions we are taking on NFR and the Board’s response on the specific matters arising within the Markets business is outlined here.",
    "Non-Financial Risk Management at ANZ Following the Royal Commission, ANZ commenced a major program to strengthen NFR management across the Bank, including greater standardisation of risk tolerance, processes and reporting.",
    "In practice, NFR refers to the risks that we face from managing our operations, our processes and systems as well as how we conduct ourselves.",
    "In 2022 the ANZ Board elevated its review of progress and accountability for the NFR program.",
    "At the time, steps included reinforcing the Executive Committee’s accountability and upgrading the technology platform underpinning the new program.",
    "The Board also appointed an independent external expert to monitor and report on progress.",
    "As of late 2023-24, the program was making good progress and meeting key milestones, while staff using the new systems were reporting an improved NFR capability.",
    "However, events associated with the Markets business in the Institutional Division (See next section) highlighted the need for an ongoing uplift in ANZ’s NFR processes and drew a response from APRA including a risk Capital overlay.",
    "In addition to ensuring delivery of the existing NFR program, the Board is also requiring further focus from Management on strengthening risk culture and embedding the new NFR processes across the bank.",

    "* Commissioning Oliver Wyman, in consultation with APRA, to undertake a thorough independent review of culture and controls within the Markets business.",
    "While some of these reviews remain ongoing, the Board has ensured accountability and consequences are enforced where relevant, particularly for the conduct and data matters.",
    "Consequences for the Executive Committee are detailed in the Remuneration Report and include: * A reduction in the Risk Modifier which reduced the outcome of the Group Scorecard and impacted variable remuneration for all employees.",
    "* Collective accountability for the entire Executive Committee regarding NFR matters, resulting in a reduction in 2024 STVR and a reduction in 2025 Long Term Variable Remuneration (LT VR) restricted rights to be granted in November/ December 2024.",

    "Our Enterprise Security Strategy drives this through three strategic goals: * Embed security across ANZ to ensure a shared responsibility for security risk + Strengthen resilience against emerging cyber threats; and * Enable business transformation through secure delivery of simple, cost effective, trusted platforms and services.",
    "Under each goal are a set of key focus areas, each outlining a desired target state.",
    "The successful delivery of each key focus area is tracked, monitored and reported through a series of annual key results — the ‘how we will deliver’.",

    "It also highlights opportunities to capitalise on evolving cloud-based technologies to both protect ANZ and crive secure transformation.",
    "Ongoing regulator-led penetration tests, cross sector exercises and regulatory changes will continue to inform regular strategy reviews.",
    "Strategy updates are presented to the Board twice a year, and to relevant technology and risk committees.",
    "These updates provide progress against the Strategy, enterprise security risks, effectiveness of security controls, and tracking of security metrics as well as views on the emerging threat landscape, regulatory compliance, and benchmarking against other organisations.",
    "An annual review of the Strategy key focus areas and key results is also undertaken with business stakeholders and presented to the Board for endorsement.",
    "Our security capability is underpinned by threat intelligence, which strengthens our ability to rapidly identify, manage, and respond to increasing and emerging threats.",
    "Global relationships with government agencies, law enforcement and industry provide timely insights into attacker tactics and techniques to inform our decisions, actions and risk reduction strategies.",
    "Our cyber security maturity has been assessed over a number of years against the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework — Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover - and compares favourably with organisations of a similar risk profile.",
    "Our cyber security protection capabilities employ a defence-in-depth model which applies multiple layers of security controls, aligned to NIST, to minimise the likelinood of a successful attack.",
    "Using artificial intelligence (Al), we proactively detect and contain active threats and restore critical services at speed and scale to limit the consequences of a compromise, with more than 13 billion events analysed by our Security Operations Centre each day.",

    "Clear governance processes and a comprehensive cyber security education program is helping to embed a strong security culture at every level of the organisation, and minimise risks associated with cyber attacks.",
    "Our education program is supported by a dedicated cyber security ambassador network, which has increased by more than 20% since 2023, with more than 800 members across 13 divisions and 22 locations.",
    "To help our people understand their responsibilities, annual mandatory learning focused on cyber security is also completed by all employees and contractors, including targeted security training for developers and engineers.",

    "Integrating Al and machine learning is also helping us automate many of the repetitious tasks in our Security Operations Centre, allowing our analysts to focus their specialised expertise on critical thinking, creative problem solving and further innovation.",
    "To put it in perspective, ANZ currently logs more than 13 billion events each day as part of monitoring, detecting and responding to potential security events and incidents across our environment.",

    "We have worked to implement personal data protection laws of China and Vietnam in 2024.",
    "Our Data Event Management (DEM) process was also enhanced this year to ensure the governance and management of potential and actual data breaches are performed efficiently, allowing us to swiftly assess, contain, and mitigate risk of harm to customers, employees, and other individuals.",

    "We remain alert and responsive to external data breaches which could include data that has been shared by us for third party operational purposes.",
    "Our Privacy Impact Assessment remains an effective tool for assessing privacy risk, and it has been added to our third-party procurement process to limit the sharing of information externally to only what is necessary.",
    "In the event of external data loss, our DEM process is triggered along with pro-active communication with the third party.",

    "The BCCC have confirmed that this matter has been closed and they have no remaining questions.",
    "Providing customers access to products and services that best suit them We acknowledge the release of Australian Securities and Investments Commission’s (ASIC) Better banking for Indigenous consumers report in July 2024, We are committed to providing our First Nations customers access to products and services that best suit them, having already simplified the account opening process in January 2024, to provide greater access to concession accounts without needing to visit a branch.",

    "* The launch of an Artificial Intelligence ‘monitoring bot’ within our Message Us chat channel on the ANZ App, which allows customers to contact bankers and receive fast tracked support.",

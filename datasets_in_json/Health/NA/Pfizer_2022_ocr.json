    "Our focus is rooted in our  purpose to deliver Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives  through ethical decision-making and our core values—Courage,  Excellence, Equity, and Joy.",
    "Stepping Up to Meet the Demands of a  Changing World  At Pfizer, our purpose—Breakthroughs that change patients’  lives—drives us to be a force for good in the world.",
    "We  believe that scientific innovation can help people live  longer, healthier lives, and we are proud to continue to  advance our scientific pipeline and strengthen our research  and development in support of this goal.",
    "Specifically, to  help ensure science will win against ongoing and future  health threats, we invested approximately $11.4 billion in  internal research and development programs in 2022.",
    "While many people know about what Pfizer does, fewer  know how we go about this work in a way that fulfills our  purpose, builds trust, and takes accountability for the impact we make on society.",
    "We take  our work seriously, as the impact is felt by not only the more than 1.3 billion patients treated  with our medicines and vaccines in 2022', but also the communities in which we, and our  stakeholders, live and work.",
    "2022—like the two years preceding it—was punctuated by a growing number of daunting  global challenges—from COVID-19, which remains a threat to global health, to political and  economic instability, to the armed conflict in Ukraine, to increased attacks on marginalized  groups that have made it harder for people to live safe, healthy, and productive lives.",
    "At the  same time, continued climate change has led to observable effects—from floods and heat  waves to droughts and dwindling ice caps—and may be linked to not-so-obvious effects, such  as potential increased health risks from air pollution, extreme weather events, and pressures  on mental health.",
    "Global action and collaboration are needed to address these issues, and as a private-sector  leader, Pfizer is committed to responding.",
    "At Pfizer, our commitment is anchored to our six ESG priorities: product innovation; equitable  access and pricing; product quality and safety; diversity, equity, and inclusion; climate  change; and business ethics.",
    "Our progress in these areas is detailed in this report, and we  look forward to continuing to engage with colleagues and other stakeholders to hear how  we can continue to enhance our impact, both within and outside of Pfizer.",
    "We also continue  1 Patient counts are estimates based on multiple data sources.",

    "Acting Ethically  Our approach to helping address the issues facing our planet and its people is rooted in our  purpose.",
    "And while our breakthroughs can take the form of new medicines and vaccines,  they can also shape new ways of working, new ways of helping ensure equitable access to  our innovations, and new ways of leveraging our voice.",
    "We're a company that is guided by our values—courage, excellence, equity, and joy.",
    "To that  end, we deploy an ethical decision-making framework that seeks to guide how we discuss,  consider and act to help address global challenges.",
    "Values-and ethics-based decision-making  promotes accountability and helps ensure that integrity, quality, safety, and ethics are  foundational to all we do.",
    "Actions > Words  These decisions have led to action.",
    "For example, we remain committed to working towards  equitable and affordable access to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Pfizer's oral  therapy for people around the world.",
    "Why?",
    "Because our vaccines and medicines cannot  positively impact patients if those patients do not have access to them.",
    "This commitment to equitable access extends beyond COVID-19.",
    "We live in a time when  science can increasingly take on the world’s most devastating diseases.",
    "But there is a gap  determining who can access these innovations, and who cannot.",
    "To help bridge this gap,  we announced in May 2022 that we will provide on a not-for-profit basis all our innovative  medicines and vaccines available in the U.S.",
    "or the European Union to 1.2 billion people  in 45 lower-income countries and will work closely with global health leaders to make  improvements in diagnosis, education, infrastructure, storage, and more.",
    "The Accord for a  Healthier World—which we expanded in January 2023 to include the full portfolio of products  for which we have global rights, bringing the total offering from 23 patented medicines and  vaccines to around 500 patented and off-patent products-aims to greatly reduce the health  inequities that exist between many lower-income countries and the rest of the world.",
    "=] Pfizer  — Continued  Action also requires stepping up during times of international crisis.",
    "We remain deeply  concerned by the human suffering we have witnessed during the ongoing armed conflict in  Ukraine, and we are committed to contributing to ongoing humanitarian efforts that support  the safety, health, and wellbeing of people affected by this tragic event.",
    "We are determined  to ensure the safety of our colleagues and their families, and we are equally determined to  facilitate continued access to our medicines and vaccines for patients.",
    "But we recognize that  we are in a position to do even more.",
    "That is why, effective March 14, 2022, Pfizer began  donating profits of our Russian subsidiary to the Pfizer Foundation?",
    "for direct humanitarian  support to the people of Ukraine, in addition to our ongoing humanitarian response efforts  in the region.",
    "Pfizer, through The Pfizer Foundation, has committed over $30 million to  support these efforts.",
    "We believe that product donations play an important role in relief and humanitarian  emergencies.",
    "We are proud to work through established non-governmental organizations  with expertise in managing product donations in connection with humanitarian emergencies.",
    "In 2022, this included Hurricane Fiona, Hurricane Ian, the Afghanistan earthquake, and the  flooding in Pakistan.",
    "We recognize that planetary health has a profound impact on human health, which is why  we are building on more than 20 years of climate action to reduce our company and value  chain Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.",
    "In June 2022, we announced our aim to achieve  the voluntary Net-Zero Standard by 2040, ten years earlier than the timeline described in  the standard.",
    "As part of this commitment, we aim to reduce our company GHG emissions  by 95 percent and our value chain GHG emissions by 90 percent from 2019 levels through  accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels and engaging suppliers to catalyze  equivalent action.",

    "Our third ESG Report, which shares our vision and approach, showcases progress on key  strategies and reaffirms our commitment to keeping patients at the center of all we do and  to furthering the positive impact that we have on the world.",
    "Nobody can predict with certainty how the world will change in 2023, and what challenges  humankind will have to overcome.",
    "But I do know this: all of us at Pfizer consider it a  privilege to be allowed by society to help address these issues.",
    "Against this backdrop, we  remain committed to keeping patients as our North Star, applying ethical decision-making  frameworks to our work, embedding ESG into our corporate strategies, and continuing to be  a force for good in the world.",

    "That's why Pfizer launched An Accord for a Healthier World in 2022 to apply what we learned and  catalyze a collective effort to help address the health equity gap.",
    "The Accord is a first-of-its kind,  comprehensive initiative focused on helping increase access to medicines and vaccines for 1.2  billion people living in 45 lower-income countries that have historically been most vulnerable to  healthcare inequalities.",
    "Alongside governments and global health organizations, Pfizer aims to  co-create scalable and sustainable solutions to help address systemic barriers to better health.",

    "Definition of Major Risks LG Electronics classifies climate change risks into two main categories: business impacts and reputational impacts related to social awareness.",
    "Business impact is the risk that climate change may have a financial impact equivalent to a reduction in projects or production/sales.",
    "We managed this by establishing proactive response strategies for each item, such as possible financial losses and loss of life.",
    "Reputational risk is defined as the risk of damage to corporate image and financial losses due to legal sanctions and conflicts related to climate change.",
    "In particular, LG Electronics, which focuses on consumer products, categorizes reputational risk as a significant impact because a decline in corporate image due to legal sanctions or conflicts can lead to a decrease in sales.",
    "Physical risk is the financial risk of direct damage to assets such as facilities and buildings.",
    "and reduced production/sales caused by increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters due to climate change, which increases the cost of doing business.",

    "Impact on LG Electronics by Scenario and Countermeasure LG Electronics conducted a quantitative and qualitative analysis of climate change risks and opportunities using the NZE 2050 and NCD transition scenarios as well as the RCP” 1.3, RCP 2.6, and RCP 8.5 scenarios to derive climate change risks and opportunities and establish mid- to long-term responses.",
    "We are also establishing risk and opportunity analysis and response plans for each scenario over the short term (0-3 years), medium term (3- 10 years), and long term (10-25 years) within a scope that includes LG Electronics’ production sites, supply chain (upstream), and the product use stage (downstream).",

    "The NZE 2050 scenario offers a narrow but achievable path towards this goal.",
    "To achieve this goal, the scenario proposes the immediate, large-scale deployment of all available clean and efficient energy technologies in the short term, as well as transformative changes needed to reduce carbon emissions.",
    "Specifically, it proposes a global reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by at least 45% from 2010 levels by 2030.",
    "In response, LG Electronics has set a target of reducing GHG emissions by 54.6% by 2030 from 2017 levels to meet the 2030 emission reduction plan based on the NZE 2050 scenario, and has completed verification from SBT.",

    "Korea, where LG Electronics’ headquarters and major production sites are located, has enacted the Framework Act on Carbon Neutral Green Growth with the goal of achieving national carbon neutrality by 2050.",
    "As part of this effort, Korea has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 compared to 2018 levels (including an 11.4% reduction in the industrial sector), and has voluntarily proposed efforts to reduce emissions, respond to climate change, provide financial resources, develop technology and capacity, and increase transparency.",
    "Moreover, LG Electronics considers the regulatory aspects of the governments in each country where it operates to be a major scenario consideration.",
    "Recently, OECD countries, including Korea, have introduced emissions trading systems and carbon taxes, with other major non-OECD countries expected to do the same.",
    "It is also expected that investments in carbon reduction will increase in various fields, such as efficiency improvement, renewable energy, and nuclear power, and that energy sources replacing fossil fuels will expand.",
    "In addition, there is a risk of rising raw material prices for LG Electronics’ products, which are produced through a global supply chain.",

    "This was the result of  heightened collaboration and evidence validation with our  global suppliers in their corrective action plans to guide  and assure improvements were being made according to  plan.",
    "In this same group, 44% of suppliers attained full  conformance to the RBA Code after one cycle of Tull audit,  correction action plan and re-audit.",
    "For continuous  improvement, we remain engaged with suppliers that show  residual nonconformance and require a second corrective  action plan to be developed for further assessment.",

    "Renewable electricity procurement includes contracted purchases and renewable electricity that automatically comes to IBM via routine grid power.",
    "Covers all of IBM’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as well as Scope 3 emissions associated with IBM’s electricity use at co-location data centers.",
    "GHG emissions from previous years and base year have been adjusted to remove GHGs not covered by the Kyoto Protocol, which are not classified as Scope 1 emissions according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.",
    "Rounded to nearest thousand.",
    "Purchased goods and services: These are the emissions associated with IBM's use of electricity in data centers located in facilities managed by third parties where IBM does not procure the electricity (also referred to as co-location data centers).",
    "Use of sold products: These are the emissions associated with the electricity consumption of our sold products when they are used by our clients.",
    "In estimating emissions from the use of our sold products, we only capture products sold during the reporting year  and account for 12 months of estimated consumption.",
    "We use product specifications such as nameplate power, quantity of products sold every year, and we make assumptions around typical client hardware utilization rates, and use industry average Power  Usage Effectiveness and global electricity GHG emission factors to estimate these emissions.",
    "We do not extrapolate this data to estimate emissions around a hypothetical lifetime of our products because that would require gross assumptions based on lifetime  and specific client applications.",
    "Upstream leased assets: In some countries, IBM provides leased vehicles for employees that they may use for personal purposes.",
    "For these vehicles, we have set standard guidelines that require leasing of vehicles with lower emissions profiles.",
    "These guidelines  enable reductions in average car emission levels as the car fleets are renewed.",
    "Business travel: These emissions are associated to business air travel on commercial carriers and car rentals.",
    "Business travel is a necessary and important part of ensuring that IBM understands our clients' needs and delivers the best client experience possible.",
    "We have worked with rental car companies to require that they offer more fuel-efficient vehicles to our employees while traveling for business.",
    "IBMers can reduce the need for travel by taking advantage of strategic collaboration and meeting tools that allow them  to easily engage with clients and their colleagues to have productive meetings, without the need for travel.",
    "Employee commuting: Our reported figure for employee commuting emissions only includes estimations made for our U.S.",
    "employees since this is the population for which we can make credible assumptions around their commuting behavior and we have access  to reliable third-party data to estimate emissions.",
    "IBM has been active for decades in promoting programs that reduce employees' work-related commutes and associated GHG emissions.",
    "For example, many locations promote biking to work by having bicycle  lockers, racks and showers available on-site.",
    "At several larger locations, IBM sponsors shuttle services to transport employees to mass transit stations and also between IBM campuses and buildings.",
    "Also, many IBM locations are within reach of the public  transportation system, giving employees the choice to use more energy-efficient mass transit to commute to work.",
    "Globally, many of our locations partner with local public transit authorities to develop ride-sharing programs and negotiate subsidized transit  passes for IBM employees.",
    "™ Biogenic emissions are CO, emissions associated with IBM’s use of biofuels.",
    "In line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, these emissions are reported separately and not accounted for as Scope 1.",
    "emissions because they are considered part of the natural  CO, cycle.",

    "Since taking up the role of Chair of the Board at the beginning of this year, | have had the privilege to witness the company’s activities and growth from the inside.",
    "| can say that with this new perspective, I’m all the more impressed by the company, its employees and the spirit with which it approaches its endeavours.",
    "Northvolt is a unique kind of company, one built around equal parts industrial logic and moral conviction.",
    "Adding weight to this opening proposition, the rationale for the company has only grown more relevant since it was first set forth in 2016.",
    "By establishing a sustainable battery industry in Europe, Northvolt aims not only to deliver a necessary supply of a crit- ical technology for the energy transition, but also to support technological sovereignty and job creation within the region.",

    "Impairment of non-financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there are indications of impairment.",
    "If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount.",
    "Impairment is recognized at the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.",
    "When cetermining value in use, future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that takes into account a risk-free interest rate and the risks specific to the asset.",
    "The Group bases its impairment calculation on the most recent budgets and business plans, which are prepared separately for each of the Group’s cash generating units.",
    "A cash-generating unit is the smallest level where cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets exist, typically a business unit or subsidiary.",
    "For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date to determine whether there is an indication that previously recognized impairment losses no longer exist or have decreased.",

    "A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized.",
    "The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.",
    "Such a reversal is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.",
    "Goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets under development not ready for use are tested for impairment annually as at the reporting date and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.",
    "Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.",
    "Impairment test The table below specifies goodwill allocated to each CGU: Our structure Our performance / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 75 For both Systems and Cuberg, assumptions on long-term revenue growth and margins strongly influence the value in use.",
    "These assumptions have been developed based on the Group’s current assessment of the sectors in question, being energy storage solutions for Systems, and electrification of the aviation sector for Cuberg.",
    "As these are developing markets, historical data offers limited quidance.",
    "Given higher performance requirements the aviation segment is assumed to allow for above average margins.",

    "If the carrying value of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.",
    "The recoverable amount has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using cash-flow projections from long term forecasts approved by management covering an 10-year period.",
    "In determining the appropriate length of projections consideration has been given to i) the intrinsic long-term nature of development and production cycles within cell and system manufacturing and ii) the significant attention the Group has allocated to developing and reviewing the same long-term financial pro- jections.",

    "In addition to the annual impairment testing of the cash-generating units and goodwill, the Group also performed an annual impairment testing of inter- nally generated intangible assets and patents.",

    "Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses, if any.",
    "The Group’s property, plant and equipment is mainly attributable to construction in progress, which includes advance payments, where the construc- tion of large-scale battery factories are underway and, in some locations, nearing completion.",
    "The cost of construction includes the purchase price plus all expenses directly attributable to the factories in order to bring it to the condition to be used in the manner intended.",
    "The directly attributable costs include works to be performed under agreement with suppliers, purchase of equipment, installation, assembly, consultancy fees, legal and advisory fees.",
    "Where it is considered directly attributable, the cost of employees and materials are also included in the asset.",
    "Materials could also be those related to commissioning of the production lines.",
    "Borrowing costs pertaining to the financing of these long term construction projects are included in the asset.",
    "Depreciation of construction in progress will only begin when the gigafactories are capable of operating in the manner intended by management, which is when the asset is activated after having passed all tests rendering it ready for use.",
    "Depreciation is then carried out on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life for all classes of property, plant and equipment, taking into account material residual value.",
    "Certain parts of the building, such as the frame and foundations, are depreciated over 75 years, and all other building components have a useful life between 10 and 40 years.",
    "Division into different components occurs only if major components with different useful economic lives can be identified.",

    "Moving to a centralized platform has brought big integration, automation and productivity gains.” According to Chris Pye, IT Strategy Manager for XPand, the move to a data-driven approach is critical to operating in the logistics sector.",
    "“Our smart use of data allows us to compete with the big guys.",
    "Our customers increasingly demand more insight into their shipments, warehouse and inventory and as CargoWise is a centralized system we can visualize that data for them, with all metrics across the supply chain, as an added service.” “CargoWise has modernized our procedures,” says Dan McNab, an account manager who has been with XPand for 11 years.",
    "“The previous system and processes were mostly manual or by email which meant we couldn't provide the online tracking and visibility of shipment ETAs and global inventory that our customers increasingly wanted — we were at risk of them outgrowing us.",
    "Now, by consolidating our warehouse, shipping and accounting systems into one, our clients can track and view their shipment information whenever they want via their online portal, export the data and use it to make informed business decisions.",
    "This saves time and dramatically reduces emails.” Some of the biggest efficiencies achieved through CargoWise automations are in XPand using the CargoWise Warehouse Management System (WMS) — a combination of Product Warehouse, Transit Warehouse and Bonded Warehouse to support different client needs.",
    "Chris Pye explains, “When | joined, the warehouse wasn't systemized.",
    "We’d do hundreds of orders in a year.",
    "Now, we do a couple of thousand orders per month, within CargoWise.",
    "That shows you how much we have grown with CargoWise.” In 2020 Xpand launched its Customs Broker Service.",
    "Dan McNab says that doing customs brokering through CargoWise saves a lot of time.",
    "“Previously we used a separate platform and there was a lot of duplication of data entry.",
    "Now, through CargoWise the data for each shipment is pulled into the broker file so that just two tabs of additional information need to be entered.” As part of XPand’s commitment to delivering exceptional services and cutting-edge logistics solutions for its customers, the business is testing and piloting CargoWise Neo, a comprehensive command center designed to elevate customers’ visibility of their supply chain operation.",
    "“We are an open book for our customers and CargoWise Neo’s modernized user interface will allow our customers to track the KPls of our performance, such as departure dates, in real time and with automated reporting.",

    "- Valin Kennedy's pursuit of a software engineering career Valin Kennedy, Associate Software Engineer Valin Kennedy has always had a curiosity for how things work.",
    "From a young age, he was fascinated with computers and spent his spare time disassembling and rebuilding them, and eventually began learning how to program cars.",
    "Naturally, this hobby evolved into a deep interest in coding which he pursued through elective subjects in high school, and online teaching platforms.",
    "Originally from regional NSW, Valin relocated to Sydney in 2024 to join our Earn & Learn program and study computer science at UTS, a move he says wouldn't have been possible without the financial support provided by the program.",
    "When and how did your passion for coding begin?",
    "Since my early years in primary school, I’ve had a strong passion for computers.",
    "| used to visit the resource recovery center at my local dump to find discarded computers, which | loved taking apart and combining parts from multiple machines to create better ones.",
    "This interest grew over time, and eventually, | saved up enough money to build a brand-new computer from scratch.",
    "In high school, | chose Information Systems Technology (IST) as an elective in Year 9 and 10.",
    "| thoroughly enjoyed learning about coding and its mechanics, and over the four years in IST and Software Design and Development (SDD) | learned to program microcontrollers like Arduinos and micro bits, create websites, and get a good understanding of the basics of coding.",
    "My passion for coding really took off during the creation of my major project for SDD.",
    "What started as a required assignment, quickly became a personal hobby.",
    "Following my project, | taught myself how to program cars and began doing so for others on a regular basis.",
    "| found programming cars so enjoyable that | realized | wanted to pursue a Career in programming.",
    "What attracted you to the Earn & Learn program?",
    "What attracted me to the Earn & Learn program was the opportunity it presented.",
    "Initially, | aimed to attend UTS for a Bachelor of Computer Science, drawn by the chance to live in Sydney and participate in their elite athlete sports program.",
    "However, the costs associated with moving from a rural area to the city made this seem like a distant goal.",
    "Learning about the Earn & Learn program changed everything.",
    "It not only provided financial assistance for relocating but also offered the exact course | wanted at UTS, coupled with valuable work experience in my desired career field.",
    "Applying for the Earn & Learn program was an easy decision for me.",
    "Can you talk a bit about your experience relocating to Sydney for the program?",
    "What have been the biggest changes you've experienced?",
    "Relocating to Sydney for the program has been a significant transition for me.",
    "Having been a boarder at my previous school for three years, | had already developed some independence skills.",
    "However, moving from a rural area four hours away to a bustling city was a larger adjustment than | anticipated.",
    "The biggest adjustments have been the everyday tasks that come with living independently.",
    "Cooking daily meals, managing laundry, including washing, drying, and ironing clothes, doing dishes, and regular grocery shopping have all been part of this new routine.",
    "The large group of people in the Earn & Learn program at WiseTech really helped me adjust to moving to Sydney.",
    "Before | moved, | didn’t know many people there, but now | have plenty of new friends to hang out with and attend university classes.",
    "It’s made me feel much more welcome in Sydney.",
    "What practical advice would you give to high school students who are keen to advance their coding skills?",
    "For high school students looking to improve their coding skills, I'd recommend getting involved in a hobby that involves coding.",
    "Whether it’s programming cars like | did, game development, exploring robotics, or any other interest, as long as it involves coding.",
    "Practicing through these hobbies not only builds coding skills but also deepens understanding of programming languages.",
    "When coding is something you enjoy as a hobby, the motivation to learn and self-teach naturally follows.",
    "This approach not only makes learning fun but also helps develop practical skills that are valuable for the future.",
    "So, my advice is to pick a coding-related hobby that excites you.",
    "Dive in, work on personal projects, and enjoy the learning process, it’s a great way to grow your skills and set yourself up for success in coding.",

    "Our remuneration strategy and framework WiseTech’s future growth and innovation rely on the talent, motivation and enthusiasm of our people across the world.",
    "We aim to reward our high-performance global workforce with a remuneration and incentive program aligned to our business strategy, specialized operations, and aspirations for sustained growth.",
    "Our remuneration framework includes cash and equity components that reward our workforce for achieving operational and strategic priorities and for creating long-term sustainable value for WiseTech and its shareholders.",
    "The elements of our global remuneration structure Our organizational focus is on developing breakthrough solutions to replace ageing legacy systems and rapid expansion to drive long-term growth for our shareholders.",
    "This requires a level of agility within our organization to allow teams to swiftly refocus priorities on activities in the short term to deliver our long-term goals.",
    "Providing remuneration equity, which is not subject to performance conditions, as a core element of our remuneration structure aligns employees’ interests with those of shareholders, encouraging behaviors that are value-creating for the long term, as well as supporting staff retention within the Group.",
    "Remuneration equity, an annual grant of multi-year deferred equity, is a key component of our team members’ fixed remuneration across our global workforce.",
    "This approach has been formally recognized as a pivotal offer under our Equity Incentives Plan by the Global Equity Organization (GEO) in their 2024 awards.",
    "WiseTech Global was honored with the Best Plan Effectiveness award, a testament to our commitment to aligning our remuneration strategy with our mission to attract, retain and motivate top talent while cultivating a culture of ownership and value creation.",
    "The GEO also commended our initiative to link equity remuneration with corporate objectives, thereby fostering long-term loyalty and accountability among our employees.",
    "Remuneration equity is typically granted at the start of the financial year and vests in four equal annual tranches: July Year 2 July Year 3 July Year 4 July Year 5 July Year 6 — Year 5 Grant — July md Year 3 Grant — July Year 4 Grant — July Total vesting 25% 50% 75% 100% 100% As detailed in the table above, the annual grant of remuneration equity with 25% vesting each year builds up, so that after four years there will be four tranches of 25% of an annual grant vesting in July each year.",
    "The above approach provides a strong alignment to shareholder outcomes as: — the number of share rights granted is based on the WiseTech share price at the time of grant, and — the value derived by an employee is based on the share price at the time of vesting.",
    "In addition to remuneration equity, certain executives are eligible to receive performance equity incentives to reward execution of, and accountability for, actions, direct outcomes and lead measures aligned to long-term strategy and annual priorities.",
    "Following the assessment of performance at the end of the financial year, any awards are delivered in share rights, with 25% vesting immediately and 25% vesting each year for the following three years.",
    "In the event that an employee (including an Executive KMP) ceases employment, unvested share rights (whether related to performance incentives or remuneration equity) will typically lapse.",
    "However, in exceptional circumstances (including genuine retirement), as detailed in the Equity Incentives Plan Rules, the Board retains discretion to determine that some, or all, of the unvested share rights will not lapse.",
    "The Equity Incentives Plan Rules grant the Board clawback powers.",
    "If, in the opinion of the Board, a participant acts fraudulently or dishonestly or is in breach of their obligations to a Group company, the Board may deem that any award of share rights held by the participant is to be forfeited.",
    "The Board did not exercise its clawback powers in FY24.",
    "During FY24, WiseTech has continued to expand the award of remuneration equity to more employees across our global team members.",
    "Where appropriate, deferred equity is also used to deliver a component of sales incentives and for sign-on or retention awards for key team members.",
    "Development team bonus pool incentives, related to specific innovation achievements that require extra discretionary effort from team members, are also delivered as deferred equity.",
    "In addition to remuneration equity, our IAYE program enables employees to acquire WiseTech shares by investing up to 20% of their post-tax salary, with an annual incentive of one free share right for each five shares acquired during the calendar year.",

    "The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.",
    "In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.",
    "The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.",

    "The lease liability is subsequently increased by the interest cost on the lease liability and decreased by lease payments made.",
    "It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, a change in the estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or as appropriate, changes in the assessment of whether a purchase or extension option is reasonably certain to be exercised or a termination option is reasonably certain not to be exercised.",
    "When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset carrying amount, or is recorded in profit or loss if the right-of-use asset carrying amount has been reduced to $nil.",
    "Key accounting estimates and judgments — Lease term The Group has applied judgment to determine the lease term for some lease contracts in which it is a lessee that include renewal options.",

    "The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.",
    "Currency risk Currency risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.",
    "The source and nature of this risk arise from operations and translation risks.",

    "However, international operations give rise to an exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates as the majority of revenue from outside Australia is denominated in currencies other than Australian dollars, most significantly US dollars and Euros.",

    "As at 30 June 2024, the Group has hedged approximately 20% for the next 12 months of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales.",
    "The Group uses forward exchange contracts and foreign currency collars to hedge its currency risk.",
    "These instruments are generally designated as cash flow hedges.",
    "The Group’s policy is for the critical terms of the foreign exchange instruments to align with the hedged item.",
    "The Group determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows.",
    "The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship is expected to be and has been effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method.",
    "In these hedged relationships, the main sources of the ineffectiveness are the effect of the counterparties and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the foreign exchange instruments, which is not reflected in the change in the fair value of the hedged cash flows attributable to the change in exchange rates; and changes in the timing of the hedged transactions.",

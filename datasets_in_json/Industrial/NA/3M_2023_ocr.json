    "If a supplier is unable or unwilling to resolve any gaps or findings, the CAPA process moves to the Responsible Sourcing Supplier Issue Escalation process.",
    "If the supplier is still unwilling to work on the gaps or can’t resolve them in a reasonable amount of time, a cross-functional team considers alternative actions to elevate and resolve the situation.",

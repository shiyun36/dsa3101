    "Buildings are imperative to solving the climate crisis Buildings are responsible for nearly 40 percent of global carbon emissions.",
    "However, the good news Is that, with the trifecta of efficiency, electrification and digitalization of buildings, we can slash carbon and operating costs at the same time.",
    "For that reason, the built environment represents one of the fastest paths, if not the fastest path, to meeting global climate targets and ensuring a viable future.",
    "At the same time, global climate targets set by the international community—to reduce carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030, while limiting global warming to 1.5°C and achieving net zero by 2050-are achievable, but time is of the essence.",
    "We have only six years left to meet global targets.",
    "The time to act is now.",
    "We have the technologies, financing and experts to transform buildings from one of the greatest climate challenges into one of the biggest climate wins.",
    "Creating a world of net zero buildings Recently, we commissioned Forrester Consulting to evaluate the state of smart buildings globally.",
    "In this landmark study of nearly 3,500 respondents across 18 industries and 25 countries, we found that, among decisionmakers on sustainability initiatives, two thirds feel they are fully on track to meet their carbon reduction goals.",
    "One third, however, need to accelerate their efforts.",
    "An overwhelming majority also reported that smart buildings are important in helping their organizations lock in carbon reduction gains.",
    "That said, siloed systems, lack of partners, disjointed internal teams and lack of visibility to key data prevent most from accurately and efficiently measuring progress against their own sustainability goals.",
    "Companies that have overcome these challenges, on the other hand, view smart building initiatives holistically.",
    "Greenhouse gas emissions Social impact and .",
    "Global sustainability employee experience Adding or upgrading building automation and digital technologies to optimize energy use are among the most impactful sustainability investment areas.",
    "A vast majority of leaders seek partners who can provide a digital platform across sites that is easy to use and Is integrated into all building systems.",
    "Smarter, more sustainable buildings give them the ability to bring together data from building systems, with measures to protect that data, a centralized mission for the data being collected and actionable intelligence provided by emerging machine learning and Al capabilities.",
    "We are the partner our customers need to solve their challenges.",
    "We also understand that every dollar needs to create greater value for our customers.",
    "Through technology and innovation, we're enabling them to embrace decarbonization in a smart way, and it shows.",
    "In fact, 70 percent of CEOs affirm that they are sticking with climate action because it’s proving Its financial value to their companies.",
    "We are the sustainability leader in buildings Throughout this report, we highlight key innovations and Initiatives that demonstrate acceleration in delivering energy efficiency and decarbonization in buildings.",
    "This includes our expertise in the solutions that form the smart building trifecta of energy-efficient equipment, clean electrification and digitalization.",
    "By upgrading equipment to make it energy efficient, replacing the use of gas and oll in buildings with electrification and aggregating data, an entirely new class of buildings is within reach.",
    "It’s a decarbonized built environment that amplifies energy, emissions and cost savings, and even enables buildings to produce more energy than they use, thereby transforming buildings from cost centers and carbon problems to cash centers and carbon solutions.",
    "How we work Data These solutions are making a difference in buildings like the Children's of Alabama medical center, where OpenBlue and heat pump technologies have delivered $450,000 in annual savings and reduced the use of natural gas by 69 percent.",
    "In Norway, OpenBlue is helping create the largest net energy-positive building in the northern hemisphere, while in Dubai Silicon Oasis, our chillers and Al-driven solutions are significantly reducing carbon footprint by some 30 percent and guaranteeing energy savings of approximately 4.2 million kWh per year.",
    "With teams, colleagues and partners across the world, we're uniquely positioned to drive these kinds of outcomes In new and existing buildings, wherever they may be.",
    "Putting the future within everyone's reach We recognize that the will to decarbonize also requires a way.",
    "This is one of the reasons we have created new paths for customers to overcome the financing gap, creating multiple mechanisms to put funding for sustainability projects within reach.",
    "So, we can make a difference now, when changes matter the most.",
    "When we electrify operations and optimize energy efficiency through our digital platform and technologies such as Al, digital twin and more, we can put data to work.",
    "This is our recipe for success, helping buildings slash carbon footprints, while saving on electric bills.",
    "Through this, we're enabling customers to accelerate action on climate, while also lifting economies and driving growth.",
    "Sustainability is no longer a trade-off, as buildings move from balance-sheet liabilities to strategic assets.",
    "Simply put, sustainability is good for business and the environment.",
    "Our own sustainability journey We have very purposefully created a company that’s uniquely qualified to meet the needs of customers at every level, creating the products, installing and servicing them, investing In advanced technologies like Al, and creating the financing structure to Support end-to-end net zero journeys - wherever they are, whatever the need.",
    "It's one of the reasons our products and solutions serve more than four million customers and are in 90 percent of the world's most iconic buildings.",
    "It's also an important factor in ensuring we live up to our ambitious carbon targets and vision for digital transformation.",
    "We're proud of the steps we've taken as a company to prioritize ESG and lead from the front.",
    "Since 2017, we have achieved a 43.8 percent absolute reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions, positioning us well on our way to achieving our 2030 goal of cutting carbon by 55 percent, a target aligned with maintaining a 1.5°C world.",
    "In addition to this, we’re also proud to have surpassed our 2030 commitment to cut our scope 3 emissions by 16 percent.",
    "As a result of this progress, we're currently ahead of schedule to reach our net zero goal by 2040, 10 years ahead of the 2050 goal set by the Paris Agreement.",

    "Global sustainability employee experience Now, we're unleashing the next generation of digitally-enabled Operating equipment that can deliver up to 50 percent additional carbon savings for our customers, on top of the run-rate efficiency of the hardware Itself.",
    "A global voice for good In our industry and beyond, we want our voice to amplify the clarion call for companies, leaders and concerned citizens to join the fight against climate change and make a difference every way we Can.",
    "Our leadership in major organizations such as the Business Roundtable and Sustainable Markets Initiative, along with engagement at major events where our speakers are in high demand like COP28, the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos and New York and London Climate Weeks, demonstrates our commitment to thought and action leadership.",
    "As such, we're proud to have been a public voice urging the ratification of the Kigali Amendment by the US Senate and to have shown the way in delivering products that put not only low, but ultra-low GWP refrigerants to work.",
    "We were also a public voice in favor of the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as similar strong Initiatives in Europe, and we're working to ensure that the important incentives in these laws and directives continue to provide businesses and Individual consumers with the market signal they need to replace old equipment with clean, low-carbon technology.",
    "How we work Data As we continue to shape and inform many of the most important global conversations, we affect positive change and promote the ongoing and necessary partnership between private and public entities.",
    "It is only through a coordinated and deliberate partnership that we'll solve the world’s sustainability challenges.",
    "Many global challenges compete for attention on the world stage, which can often pull focus away from the pressing issue of climate change.",
    "As a team of more than 100,000, our focus and resolve remain unchanged.",
    "We're committed to creating a horizon of healthier, safer, more sustainable buildings and a brighter future for all.",
    "We thank you for taking the time to read our annual sustainability report.",
    "We're proud of the progress made this year and we look forward to the many successes ahead as we pursue our purpose and continue to make the global transition toward more sustainable buildings a reality.",

    "Corporate Knights reviews our sustainable revenue metrics and has listed Johnson Controls as number 31 on Corporate Knights Clean 200, up from number 40 last year.",
    "The sustainable revenue definition includes: Products that enable beneficial electrification of heating Products that exceed minimum energy efficiency regulations for cooling or heating Products that use low-GWP refrigerants Products that enable greater energy efficiency in buildings, including energy recovery, building control and automation systems, and other connected products Digital solutions, such as OpenBlue, our complete ecosystem of connected technologies, expertise and services Products that are manufactured with recycled or reground materials Revenue from the installation, maintenance and service attributable to the products listed above 18 Data 90% R&D invested In sustainable products and services 57% sustainable revenue The CLEAN 200® LIST Develop low-carbon and energy efficient products Addressing climate change necessitates that we manage our entire carbon footprint in alignment with a 1.5°C reduction trajectory.",
    "With the vast majority of our scope 3 emissions coming from the use of sold products, it’s critical that we deliver low-carbon solutions to our customers.",
    "At Johnson Controls, we're leading the carbon transition with sustainable products and services across three strategic pillars: energy efficiency, low-GWP refrigerants and electrification.",
    "Energy efficiency Why: Building heating, cooling and ventilation operation is responsible for over 50 percent of energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings, thus representing a significant share of the nearly 40 percent of global GHG emissions attributable to the built environment.",
    "Improving the energy efficiency of these products will reduce energy-related emissions and our customers’ operational expenses, while also creating a smoother transition to a distributed, zero-carbon energy system.",
    "What: Johnson Controls has a market-leading portfolio of energy-efficient HVAC products, many of which exceed regulatory and market requirements by 30 percent or more.",
    "Despite this, we continue to improve the energy efficiency of our products, through incremental improvements to existing models, new product launches that result in significant changes in efficiency, assisting our customers in making optimal product selections for their applications, and shifting our share of products sold to higher efficiency models.",
    "Example: YORK® YVAM and CYK chillers Specifically optimized for data center operations, the YVAM air-cooled chiller eliminates water consumption and Is 49 percent more efficient than conventional air-cooled chillers.",
    "The CYK heat pump chiller, on the other hand, can achieve a coefficient of performance (COP) as high as 8.0, meaning that it produces eight times the working energy it consumes, while providing simultaneous heating and cooling, with hot water temperatures up to 170°F.",
    "At these temperatures, our heat pumps can take on hard-to-abate end uses, such as space heating in complex commercial buildings and industrial process heating.",
    "19 Global sustainability Case study: The TIGER at Princeton University Princeton University is taking substantial action, now, to achieve their goal of a Net Zero Campus by 2046.",
    "To this end, Johnson Controls is working with Princeton University on their unique TIGER (Thermally Integrated Geo-Exchange Resource) Energy Plant in Princeton, New Jersey.",
    "It is a truly innovative and sustainable project resulting in truly decarbonized cooling and heating for the 180 buildings on campus.",
    "The multimillion-dollar project uses our high-capacity, high-temperature YORK CYK Compound Centrifugal Electric Heat Pumps to draw low-temperature heat from either a geoexchange field or the chilled water system and it pumps this heat into the new 145°F campus district hot water system.",
    "Thus, the heat pumps can cool the chilled water and heat the hot water at the same time.",
    "Or when using the geoexchange system, heat can be pulled from the chilled water system in the summer - and stored seasonally until the winter - when It can be used as a low-temperature heat source for the heat pumps.",
    "This system Is dramatically more efficient than Princeton's old steam system.",
    "The heat pumps are How we work Data powered only by electricity, which greatly reduces the university's reliance on fossil fuels.",
    "Ultimately, the university Is planning on buying 100% carbon-free electricity, which will reduce Princeton's carbon emission to near zero.",
    "This conversion to the new geoexchange/ heat pump/hot water system will be phased In over many years.",
    "Ultimately, there will be 2100 geoexchange bores that are each 850-foot deep.",
    "A new underground low- temperature (145°F) hot water district system Is being installed to connect the heat pump plants to the campus buildings.",
    "Each of these buildings will be modified to use hot water for their heating system instead of steam.",
    "It's anticipated that the university will almost eliminate the use of natural gas, reduce campus domestic water consumption by 20%, and reduce carbon emissions to near zero with the use of carbon-free electricity.",
    "Why: Conventional refrigerants used in today’s HVAC products are hydrofluorocarbons Why: Most of the world’s heating needs today are met with direct fossil fuel combustion.",
    "(HFCs), fluids that do not harm the ozone layer, but can have high Global To decarbonize our buildings and maintain a reliable grid, we need to efficiently Warming Potential (GWP).",

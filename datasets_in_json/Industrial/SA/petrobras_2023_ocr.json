    "In addition, Ela Management Company, and certain affiliated funds (collectively, “ElG\") filed a lawsuit against Petrobras on February 23, 2016 before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.",
    "The plaintiffs allege that our company committed fraud by inducing them to invest In Sete Brasil Participacdes S.A.",

    "Petrobras will proceed with administrative misconduct actions against Novonor Group companies, seeking full compensation for the losses identified as a result of the illegal acts disclosed by Operation Car Wash, but to comply with the Leniency Agreements, while they are in force, it will not seek sanctions or precautionary measures, among others, against these companies.",
    "Ihe Closing Agreement also does not exempt Novonor Group companies from submitting to the process of evaluating the requirements to be included in the supplier register or to participate in Petrobras: competitive contracting procedures, including integrity, In accordance with the applicable rules and ina timely manner, respecting the principles of isonomy and impersonality.",
    "It is also worth mentioning that in events that occurred in Singapore, six former executives of Keppel Offshore & Marine Limited were investigated by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau - \"CPIB\") for their roles in paying bribes to approximately USS 55 million to employees of Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.",

    "Due to lack of sufficient evidence, in consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers (\"AGC\"), on 11 January 2023, the CPIB decided to issue strict warnings to the six individuals rather than prosecute them for offenses punishable under the Corruption Prevention Law.",

    "As an example of waste generated in our processes we have: oily sludge, drilling fluids and gravelss, industrial effluent station sludge, spent catalysts, used lubricating oils, spent acidic or basic solutions, fuel filtering elements, paper, plastics, wood, and debris from civil construction.",
    "In our units, the sources of waste generation are the activities of production and processing of raw materials and intermediate streams, effluent treatment, preventive and corrective equipment maintenance processes, engineering works, as well as office activities.",

    "Our solid waste management follows the waste management hierarchy established in current legislation: non-generation, reduction, reuse, recycling, treatment of solid waste and environmentally appropriate final waste disposal, with the aim of avoiding or mitigating possible environmental impacts.",
    "Since 2014, we have adopted circular economy practices in our activities to prevent the generation of solid waste, with emphasis on the reuse of oily sludge in the production of shale oil and green petroleum coke.",
    "I hese practices made It possible to reduce the generation of hazardous waste by more than half, from 245,000 tons to 79,600 tons in ten years, minimizing any negative impacts on the environment and people.",
    "!",
    "In our operations in the Amazon, around 40% of the waste generated is organic.",

    "In 2024, we completed the public selection process focusing on the collection and adequate disposal of recyclable solid waste and, at the beginning of this year, we began partnerships with three social projects in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro.",
    "We will forward solid waste such as plastic, paper, wood and glass generated in four properties in the capital of Rio de Janeiro and Baixada Fluminense (ARM RIO, Research Center - Cenpes), Galpao Belford Roxo and Conjunto Caju) to the cooperatives COOPCARMO, ACAMGJ and COOPAMA, which have the potential to receive around 600 tons of recyclable materials per year.",
    "The initiative is aligned with our strategic framework of generating value for society and the commitment to protect the environment by increasing the allocation of solid waste to reuse, recycling, and recovery routes, in addition to preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate issues through carbon capture.",
    "In addition to the materials, the cooperatives will receive resources to be Invested in training and improving the education of the collectors, vehicle maintenance, sheds, and equipment, and in environmental education actions.",
    "logether, the OO®@ projects add up to an investment of BRL 8.9 million to be disbursed over the next three years.",
    "Additionally, to mitigate the potential adverse impacts generated by waste, we implemented preventive and corrective actions described in our process standards and specific internal technical standards on the subject, in addition to following Brazilian and international technical standards.",
    "For the development of new projects, we use the Front-End Loading (FEL) methodology for planning and approval of each phase of the project based on technical, economic, and environmental feasibility, in which technical criteria related to minimizing the generation and optimization of the destination of waste.",
    "Routinely, several studies are carried out as part of the environmental licensing process in order to identify and assess the socio-environmental impacts throughout the developments lite cycle, thus mitigating impacts related to solid waste management.",

    "New sustainable destination policy for floating platforms We are actively following, at a global level, discussions on platform dismantling and recycling, aiming at bringing the best environmental practices and market engagement to the Brazilian scenario, to sustainably execute platform decommissioning projects .",
    "Among the main changes achieved in recent years, a major highlight is the adoption of a new sustainable destination model for our own floating platforms, whose implementation began in 2025.",
    "The new guidelines minimize risks of violation of human and environmental rights, as they incorporate, among others, the following requirements, and assumptions into the process: - it recycling takes place in international shipyards, information on the minimum notice period for x operational changes and programs for improving employees skills and assistance for career transition INTRODUCTION [| ACTINGWITHINTEGRITY | REDUCING THECARBON FOOTPRINT | PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT | CARINGFOR PEOPLE - it recycling takes place in national shipyards, they must present specific licenses and authorizations for recycling activities and management of residues and waste arising from the process, in addition to proof of compliance with applicable legislation, rules and regulations regarding the environment, safety and worker health, including subcontractor management; - obligation to carry out recycling in shipyards equipped with technological solutions that guarantee the containment of contaminants resulting from dismantling activities, preventing their release into the environment; -implementation of actions to minimize waste generation, prevent impacts on biodiversity, in addition to reusing equipment and materials and promoting the circular economy; *orior identification of hazardous materials and waste existing on the vessel, through inventories prepared by the company, in order to guarantee the adequate oreparation of arecycling plan by the shipyard; -approval of the shipyard recycling plan by the company; and *monitoring of recycling activities.",
    "OO®@ guarantees that they occur in line with the best ESG practices in the global industry.",
    "The adoption of the new policy generates numerous opportunities for new investments and the development of the circular economy with a multiplier effect for the economy and the country, as it allows for the redefinition of the structures involved, significantly expanding the socioeconomic benefits associated with this phase end of the production cycle of the oil and gas segment.",
    "In addition to the steel industry, which directly benerits from all the metal scrap resulting from the process, opportunities for several other segments are also opening up.",
    "Companies that demand other materials that result from dismantling, companies that operate in the waste management chain, companies that operate In cargo transport, academia and companies that develop technologies that will be incorporated into production and operational processes, in addition to the naval industry itself, just to name a few industries, will also be positively affected by this process.",

    "Among the global actions, we highlight the identification and blocking of the spill source, mobilization of Oil Spill Response Vessels (OSRV), for assessment and assistance with the mechanical dispersion and/or containment, collection of the spilled oil, and the sending of aircrafts to do a flyover diagnosis, providing guidance for vessels deployed for mitigation.",
    "For onshore events, similarly, the Emergency Plans are also activated and the EOR is established (at the same time in which operational maneuvers are carried out to interrupt the spill source).",
    "As part of the actions, the emergency response, property security, and cleaning teams are activated, as well as equipment to collect the spilled oil.",
    "Subsequently, it is our practice to carry out coverage based on the recommendations resulting from the PETROBRAS | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 ACTING WITH INTEGRITY |!",
    "REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT |!",
    "accident investigation in order to act preventively in other units where there are similarities in processes Or equipment that are associated with the root cause of the accident, promoting process improvement, and raising the level of operational safety.",
    "The Mar Azul Program, which was incorporated into the Commitment to Life Program, continued to cover lessons learned from events that took place since 2020, improving the integrity of protection barriers, routine processes and activities at offshore production facilities, acting through of an active and continuous management in search of improvement opportunities.",
    "We adopt health and safety practices that, in addition to ensuring the readiness of our contingency bases, also seek safe and efficient emergency responses, with the activityor expert professionals.",
    "Our subsidiary Transpetro also has computerized systems for monitoring the integrity of the asset it operates.",
    "Ihe software helps teams to implement maintenance techniques to prevent the loss of primary containment, mitigating the risk of accidental spillage of transported products to the environment.",
    "The spill prevention strategy adopted by Iranspetro considers: PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT | OO®@ a) inspection, maintenance, and service activities for the integrity of equipment, pipeline systems and pipeline tracks; CARING FOR PEOPLE b) compliance with operating procedures, training of operators and control of process variables; c) communication and relationship activities with communities close to the pipelines.",
